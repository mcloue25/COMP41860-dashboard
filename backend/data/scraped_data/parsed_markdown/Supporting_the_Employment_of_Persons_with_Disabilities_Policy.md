Approval date and body

21/06/2022, UMT

## 1.  Purpose

The University is committed to providing an inclusive environment in which all members of  our  University  community should expect to be able to thrive and be respected and valued for their unique perspectives, and contributions so that people can achieve their fullest potential through real opportunities to participate in, and contribute to, University activities. UCD has developed this policy to ensure it provides equality of opportunity in the attraction, employment, retention, and development of persons with disabilities. It is committed to taking proactive steps to ensure its workplace culture supports employees with disabilities to feel confident and comfortable to disclose disabilities so that supports can be provided to enable employees to thrive at work. The University seeks to create an affirmative and inclusive culture for employees who have or acquire disabilities during their working life.

Note: The University uses the term disability reflecting national and European equality legislation  and  is  the  umbrella  term  used  for  the  purpose  of  this  policy  to  include  all individuals that fall under the legal definition as outlined below. Whilst it is acknowledged that not all employees with disabilities identify with this term it is important that they are included under this policy so that employees receive the necessary supports.

This policy supports UCD's EDI Strategy and Core Objective 4 of UCD's Strategy 2020-2024 is to 'attract, retain, and develop an excellent and diverse cohort of students, faculty and employees'. The Public Sector also has a target of employing a minimum of

3% of people who have a disability. This statutory target is expected to increase to 6% in 2024.

This policy is underpinned by national legislation and the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ratified in Ireland in 2018.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees in UCD.

## 3. Definitions

## Disabilities

In  the  context  of  employment,  the  term  "disabilities"  means  employees  with  physical, sensory, or psychological impairments, which may:

- have a tangible impact on their functional capability to do a particular job; or
- have an impact on their ability to function in a particular physical environment; or
- lead to either direct or indirect discrimination, in obtaining or keeping employment of a kind for which, they would otherwise be suited;

Under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 the 'EA Acts', disability is defined as -

- a) the total or partial absence of a person's bodily or mental functions, including the absence of a part of a person's body,
- b) the presence in the body of organisms causing, or likely to cause, chronic disease or illness,
- c) the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of a person's body,
- d) a condition or malfunction which results in a person learning differently from a person without the condition or malfunction, or
- e) a condition, illness or disease which affects a person's thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgement or which results in disturbed

behaviour, and shall be taken to include a disability which exists at present, or which previously existed but no longer exists, or which may exist in the future, or which is imputed to a person.

Neurodiversity is sometimes used as an umbrella term for neurological traits in people For example, autism, dyslexia, ADHD (attention, deficit, hyperactivity disorder), dyspraxia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia. Depending on the neurodiverse variation and its intensity, individuals can display strengths in different areas which is an invaluable asset in workplaces. These traits fall under the definition of disability as per the legislation.

## Acquired Disabilities

Acquired disability is a disability that has developed during the person's lifetime - that is as a result of an accident or illness rather than a disability the person was born with.

## Invisible Disabilities

Invisible disabilities refer to disabilities which may not be visible at a glance but can have a major impact on people's lives. They can arise from conditions such as epilepsy, autism, diabetes, acquired brain injuries and some chronic illnesses. Invisible disability, or hidden disability is an umbrella term that captures a whole spectrum of disabilities or challenges.

## Disclosure

When a person with a disability communicates a disability to another person. UCD encourages a culture where employees feel confident to share their disability status in the workplace. Employees may share a disability status with their team or manager to raise awareness but may not request supports at that time. Other reasons for disclosing a disability to your employer may include:

## 1.  Disclosure to obtain a reasonable accommodation

It is the policy in the University to ensure that, insofar as is practicable, the working environment is inclusive of employees with disabilities.

- The University will take appropriate measures to assess and where possible meet the needs of employees/potential employees with disabilities in the workplace.
- Reasonable accommodation must only be provided where the provision of such measures would not impose a disproportionate burden on the employer.
- Disclosing a disability is voluntary and it is not required of any employee or job candidate to divulge specific personal information about a disability.

## 2.  Disclosure on health and safety grounds where the disability may increase the risk to the staff member from workplace hazards

There are certain conditions that the University should be informed about so that any attendant risks can be appropriately assessed.

These conditions include but are not limited to: epilepsy grand mal; hemophilia; insulin dependent diabetes; restricted mobility; and significant hearing impairment). Employees are encouraged to disclose such conditions to their HR Partner or the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Unit who will liaise with Safety, Insurance and Risk Compliance (SIRC) Office so that any attendant risks can be appropriately assessed.

## Reasonable Accommodation

Reasonable accommodation (RA) can mean some modification to tasks or the structure of a job or the workplace which allows a qualified employee with a disability to do their job and enjoy equal employment opportunities.

Under the EA Acts, employers are obliged to provide reasonable accommodation for employees (subject to some caveats referenced below). In other words, the University must take appropriate measures to enable a person who has a disability to access and participate in employment or undertake training.

Reasonable accommodation must only be provided where the provision of such measures would not impose a disproportionate burden on the employer. The financial cost to the University, the scale and financial resources of the University, public funding or other assistance are examples of some of the factors that may be considered in this regard.

## Campus Accessibility

The University is committed to developing an accessible campus for employees with a disability. The University has a Campus Accessibility Officer to advise and guide the University in its duties under the Disability Act 2005. The Act requires public bodies to ensure that buildings and services are universally accessible to employee, students and visitors with disabilities.

## Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan

Upon request plans are prepared for employees who require a Personal Emergency Evacuation Plan to ensure they exit campus buildings quickly and safely in case of an emergency.

## Risk Assessment

A person with a disability (in common with every other employee) has an obligation to ensure their own safety and the safety of others at the place of work. This obligation may extend to engaging in risk assessments, consulting with the University (or any qualified professional) regarding the implementation of measures and highlighting any concerns as they may arise to the University from a health and safety perspective.

Section 5 of this policy includes information on Safety, Health and Welfare regarding covid-19 return to work under 'supports.

## Returning from Sick Leave

Employees returning from sick leave may require reasonable accommodations. HR Partners support employees and managers on the identification and implementation, where possible, of reasonable accommodations.

## Universal Design

Under the Disability Act 2005, 'universal design' means the design and composition of an environment, electronic systems, any electronics-based process of creating products, services or systems so that it may be accessed, understood and used by persons of any age or size or having any particular physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual ability or disability.

## 3. Principles
