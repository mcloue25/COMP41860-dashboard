## 1. Purpose

UCD is committed to upholding academic integrity. The Academic Integrity Policy and the Student Code of Conduct outline this commitment, and the standards of academic conduct expected of students.  This procedure is intended to assist academic staff in effectively addressing instances of alleged student academic misconduct and to guide students in understanding the steps that will be followed by schools. It is also intended to provide students with clear and transparent information about the procedure that will be followed when suspected incidents arise in relation to their work.

This procedure is intended to support the application of procedural fairness for all students. It has been established on the principles of natural justice. Those with responsibility for applying this procedure should:

- treat students fairly, consistently and in a transparent manner,
- apply penalties that are fair and proportionate,
- respect the dignity of all persons involved,
- make decisions that are free from bias.

This document should be read in conjunction with related documents: Academic Integrity Policy, the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Discipline Procedure and relevant guidelines issued by the University from time to time.

## 2. Scope

All forms of academic misconduct are unacceptable and will be addressed under the relevant University procedure. This procedure should be followed in instances where specific categories of academic misconduct are suspected or alleged in any work submitted for assessment by students registered to taught programmes. The following categories of academic misconduct have been identified as suitable for consideration by School Academic Integrity Committees and Module Coordinators. Definitions and examples relating to each category are presented in Section 3 of this procedure.

- Plagiarism
- Self-Plagiarism
- Recycling
- Misrepresentation of authorship
- Contract cheating
- Collusion / Violating the limits of acceptable collaboration

## 3. Definitions

## 3.1 Academic Misconduct

The Academic Integrity Policy provides the following definitions and examples of academic misconduct, which are taken from the National Academic Integrity Network Lexicon of Common Terms.  These are the definitions and examples of categories of academic misconduct that should be addressed using this procedure.

1 Guidance for faculty and students on Unauthorised Academic File Sharing is available in guidelines.

3.1.1 Plagiarism : Presenting work / ideas taken from other sources without proper acknowledgement. Plagiarism is a failure to cite or otherwise acknowledge ideas or phrases used in any paper, exercise assessment or project submitted in a course but gained from another source, such as a published text, another person's work, or materials on the internet.

- Plagiarism includes presenting work for assessment, publication, or otherwise, that:
- o uses phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or longer extracts from published or unpublished work (including from the internet) without appropriate acknowledgement of the source.
- o presents direct extracts without quotation marks or other appropriate indication. Note: It is not sufficient simply to acknowledge the source.
- o copies the same or a very similar idea from a published or unpublished work without appropriate acknowledgement.
- o changes the order of words taken from source material but retains the original idea or concept without appropriate acknowledgement.
- o copies or uses, without appropriate acknowledgement, any material from non-written work including, but not limited to, visual and digital media, images, computer code, musical notation, recording or composition, performance or oral presentations; or
- o uses the work of another student without appropriate acknowledgement in a way that exceeds the bounds of legitimate cooperation.

Plagiarism is unacceptable in academic work, even where it arises as a result of:

- o poor referencing;
- o error;
- o inability to paraphrase; or
- o inhibition about writing in the student's own words.

3.1.2 Self-Plagiarism : Reusing one's own work without citing or acknowledging its original use. This could mean submitting one piece of work in more than one course.

3.1.3 Recycling : The practice of data fragmentation or salami slicing where the author(s) separates aspects of a study or their work. Writers should recycle their own material carefully and sparingly.

3.1.4 Misrepresentation of authorship: The submission of someone else's work (or part thereof) as one's own, when the work (all or in part) has been produced by, or purchased from, another person or party.

3.1.5 Contract cheating: a form of academic misconduct where a person uses an undeclared and/or unauthorised  third  party,  online  or  directly,  to  assist  them  to  produce  work  for  academic  credit  or progression, whether or not payment or other favour is involved.

The NAIN Lexicon of Common Terms provides the following examples of contract cheating:

- Buying a completed assignment from a tutoring or ghost-writing company (purchasing from online essay mill websites);
- Asking a partner, friend or family member to write part or all of an assignment for you;
- Paying a private tutoring company to coach you on how to complete an assignment;
- Submitting 'model' assignment answers provided by a private tutor or tutoring company;
- Getting someone else to sit an exam for you;
- Sitting an exam for someone else;
- Buying, selling or swapping assignments or assignment answers via 'sharing' websites or social media platforms, e.g. Facebook, TikTok etc. Examples  of prohibited services that students can use to have work produced for them include:
- o essay writing services;
- o friends, family and other students;
- o private tutors;
- o copyediting services;
- o agency websites;
- o reverse classifieds.

3.1.6 Collusion or violating the limits of acceptable collaboration in coursework set by a faculty member or School, through undisclosed collaboration of two or more people on an assignment or task, which is supposed to be completed individually. Examples of collusion include, but are not limited to:

- Using another student's work and submitting it for assessment as your own.
- Giving your work to another student to submit as part of their own assessment.
- Co-writing work, without acknowledgment, that will be submitted for assessment.
- Working with other students without permission to produce material that will be assessed or to produce responses to assessment questions.
- Using social media / chat rooms message groups to collude during the completion of online assessments.
- Inappropriately assisting another student with the production of an assessment task, including sharing answers or providing drafts or completed copies of an assessment task. If a student makes an inequitable contribution to a group assignment and claims credit for the work of others, this is collusion and may be considered as academic misconduct

3.1.7 Facilitating academic dishonesty by assisting another student to obtain an academic advantage by dishonest or unfair means.

3.1.8 Inappropriately using digital or information technology to complete an assessment task; i.e., using  such  technology  without  explicit  permission  from  relevant  academic  staff  and  /  or  not acknowledging use of such technology when its use is permitted. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- unauthorised and / or unacknowledged use of artificial intelligence tools to generate content for assessment purposes; or,
- unauthorised  and  /  or  unacknowledged  use  of  paraphrasing  or  translation  software  to,  for example, disguise plagiarism, collusion, contract cheating or other academic integrity breach.

3.1.9 Ghost writing or authorship by use of a non-named (merited, but not listed) author to write or prepare a text for publication. Examples of ghost writing include, but are not limited to :

- Writing for or in the name of someone else.
- Assisting in the production of work resulting in unfair advantage to someone else .

3.2 Academic Integrity Adviser : Optional school role intended to support academic staff by providing advice on issues relating to Academic Integrity and other responsibilities delegated by  the relevant Head of School.

3.3  School Academic Integrity Committee :  The  school  level  committee  responsible  for  decisionmaking in relation to alleged incidents of academic misconduct.

3.4 Chair of the School Academic Integrity Committee: ensuring that the committee meetings with student follows the procedure outlined in this this document and that committee decisions are recorded.

3.5 School Academic Integrity Protocol : Schools are required to publish a protocol which provides students and faculty with information about how this procedure is applied within the school. Protocols include  information  such  as  the  name  of  the  School  Academic  Integrity  Adviser,  if  one  has  been appointed, and Academic Integrity Committee membership, the school's required citation style and referencing system and information about the steps that will be followed where academic misconduct is alleged.

3.6 Poor Academic Practice: mi nor errors or inconsistencies in a student's work such as inadequate citation; poor referencing, inappropriate paraphrasing; overreliance on sources without sufficient input of the students own work.

' Poor  academic  practice  may  result  from  a  learner's  lack  of  understanding  of  what  is  expected  in producing a piece of academic work. It might include poor referencing, weak citation, or failure to identify the contributions made by others in completing the work. Such errors can arise from inexperience or carelessness  rather  than  a  clear  intention  to  deceive. ' NAIN  Framework  for  Academic  Misconduct Investigation and Case Management.

In the context of this procedure Module Coordinators may choose to address minor examples of poor academic practice directly without referring the matter to the School Academic Integrity Committee.

3.7  Mitigating  and  Aggravating  Factors: when  determining  an  appropriate  penalty,  the  School Academic Integrity Committees may consider aggravating and/or mitigating factors.

Aggravating Factors:  circumstances  that  increase  the  severity  of  academic  misconduct,  warranting stricter  penalties.  These may include repeated offenses, deliberate deception, premeditation, largescale impact, involvement of third parties, or refusal to take responsibility.

Mitigating Factors: circumstances that reduce the severity of misconduct, which warrant consideration of a more lenient penalty. These may  include first-time offenses, lack of intent, genuine misunderstanding, demonstrated remorse, cooperation during the investigation, or challenging personal circumstances which may have affected judgement.

## 5. School Academic Misconduct Investigation Procedure

## 5.1 Module Coordinator Review

## 5.1.1 Incidents of Poor Academic Practice

It  is  recognised that early-stage learners may find it difficult to transition to the standards and skills required  in  assessments  at  third  level  education  institutes,  and  this  may  lead  to  incidents  of  poor academic practice in assessments.  The NAIN Frame work notes that 't imely discussions with learners help  raise  awareness  of  what  constitutes  academic  integrity  and  what  practices  are  considered unacceptable and why.' U nder this procedure Module Coordinators have discretion to address minor incidents  as  poor  academic  practice  directly  with  the  student,  using  the  incident  as  a  learning opportunity where additional guidance can be offered and training recommended.  Module coordinators may consult with the School Academic Integrity Adviser, (where one has been appointed) or the Chair of the Academic Integrity Committee for guidance relating to individual cases, as appropriate. (See Section 4.3)

Some examples of poor academic practice that may be suitable for Module Coordinators to address include:

- Inadequate citation such as poor referencing.
- Inappropriate paraphrasing, where it demonstrates the need for further guidance on referencing and citation.
- Overreliance on sources without sufficient input of the student's own work.
- A  small  element  of  the  work  and/or  an  element  in  a  piece  of  work  which  makes  a  small contribution to the grade for the assessment component is affected.

5.1.2 When choosing to deal with incidents of poor academic practice directly Module Coordinators should note the following:

- Incidents are not reported to the School Academic Integrity Committee and the student will not be subject to a disciplinary process.
- Incidents are not recorded in the University's Academic Misconduct Record System.
- Reports produced by the University's originality checking software should be reviewed carefully before discussing them with students.

5.1.3 When reviewing a student's assessment and deciding on whether an incident should be referred to the School Academic Integrity Committee, Module Coordinators may consider relevant factors which may include the following:

- The  experience  and  stage  of  the  student,  for  example,  failure  to  cite  correctly  may  be considered as poor academic practice for inexperienced students but for later stage students, who have received appropriate guidance, referral to the School Academic Integrity Committee will likely be appropriate.
- The nature of the academic misconduct, whether the work demonstrates clear errors rather than any attempts to deceive.
- Poor academic practice that is extensive in an assessment may warrant referral to the School Academic Integrity Committee.
- The proportion of the assessment that has been impacted, for example, the presence of one of the examples of poor academic practice impacting a small amount of the assessment compared to multiple examples of poor academic practice impacting a large proportion of the assessment.
- The category of academic misconduct.
- Has the Module Coordinator previously provided feedback or guidance on any of the examples of poor academic practice.
- Any additional school guidance that may have been developed.

5.1.4 Module Coordinators deciding to address the matter with the student directly should take one of the following actions:

- a) Arrange a meeting with the student to discuss the issue that has arisen with their assessment, or
- b) Highlight the issue in feedback on the assessment.

As part of the above actions Module Coordinators may provide information or advice about academic integrity and avoiding academic misconduct and may refer students to other resources such as the UCD Library Guides, or the University Writing Centre.

5.1.5 Module  Coordinators  may  reflect  poor  academic  practice  in  the  grade  awarded  using  the Component Grade Scale. Module Coordinators should be explicit with students where grades have been impacted due to poor academic practice.

## 5.2 Referral to the School Academic Integrity Committee

Where a Module Coordinator decides to refer an alleged incident of academic misconduct to the School Academic Integrity Committee they will:

- Submit a short report outlining the grounds of suspicion, a copy of the piece of work and any supporting evidence to the School Academic Integrity Committee.
- Advise the student that their assessment has been referred to the School Academic Integrity Committee. The communication should advise that the School Academic Integrity Committee will contact them in relation to the matter and highlight the supports available, such as their Student Adviser or an SU representative.

## 5.3 School Academic Integrity Committee Procedure

5.3.1 On receiving a report of alleged academic misconduct the School Academic Integrity Committee will establish whether there has been a previous recorded breach on the University's Academic Misconduct Record System. In cases where a student has been referred previously to a School Academic Integrity Committee and found to be in breach of the terms of the University's Academic Integrity Policy, the Committee will make a judgement as to whether the recurrence can be handled as an academic matter at school level or whether it merits referral to the Student Discipline Procedure. If, in the view of the School Academic Integrity Committee the matter can be dealt with as a poor academic practice the case may be referred back to the Module Coordinator for resolution.

Where the Committee decides to address the report at the school level the Committee will:

- Issue a communication to the student outlining the alleged academic misconduct and invite them to a meeting to discuss the matter.
- Provide  the  student  with  a  copy  of  the  Module  Coordinator's  report  and  any  supporting evidence.
- Advise the student that they may be accompanied to meetings by a support person, who may be a student adviser, students' union representative, friend or family member.
- Where a student fails to respond within reasonable timeframes, or where despite reasonable efforts to accommodate the student's availability, they do not attend the meeting, the committee may proceed to consider the matter in their absence, based on the documentary evidence.

## 5.3.2 Composition of a School Academic Integrity Committee

- Schools may choose to establish a three-person standing Academic Integrity Committee or establish an Academic Integrity Panel of academic staff from which members will be used to convene committees on a case-by-case basis.
- Schools may appoint as many academic staff as they wish to the panel.
- Where  a  panel  is  used  it  is  recommended  that  a  standing  chair  is  appointed  to  enhance consistency of decision-making.
- For the purpose of reviewing reported incidents  the  School Academic Integrity Committee will comprise three members, a Chair and two additional members of academic staff.
- Where a Module Coordinator who submits a report to the School Academic Integrity Committee is also a committee member, they must be replaced by an alternate member.

## 5.3.3 Following review of the submission the School Academic Integrity Committee

The m odule coordinator's report will be reviewed by the Committee and one of the following decisions will be taken:

- If the nature and extent of academic misconduct warrants it, the case may be referred directly to the Student Discipline Procedure, in line with the process set out at Section 5.3.6.
- Academic misconduct proceedings will be initiated, and the student will be invited to meet the School Academic Integrity Committee to discuss the alleged academic misconduct case. Reasonable efforts should be made to accommodate students' requests to chang e the meeting time/date. However, if the student does not respond to the meeting notification, or cannot or does not attend the meeting, the committee may proceed in their absence, based on the documentary evidence.
- While it is expected that students will normally attend meetings with the School Academic Integrity Committee, as this provides the best opportunity for the committee to understand the incident and for the student to be guided on academic integrity, chairs of the Academic Integrity Committee may permit a student to submit a written response, where it is deemed appropriate.

## 5.3.4 Meeting Protocol and Decision-making

The following meeting protocol should be followed by School Academic Integrity Committees:

- The Chair will welcome all attendees, the student, the committee members, the support person (if in attendance) and will introduce the Committee members.
- The  Chair  will  outline  the  alleged  misconduct  to  the  committee,  drawing  on  the  module coordinator's report and supporting documentation submitted to the committee.
- The student will be asked to respond to the allegation / provide an explanation for the anomalies outlined.
- If the student accepts that the substance of the allegation is true, the committee may proceed to determine an appropriate penalty.
- If  the  student  denies  the  allegation,  the  committee will  ask  the  student  further  questions  to determine, based on the evidence before them and on the balance of probabilities, whether they believe that the student has breached the Academic Integrity Policy .
- Once the committee is satisfied that all relevant information has been heard and there are no further questions, the committee may begin to deliberate in private.  At this point the student and their support person (if in attendance) will be asked to leave the meeting.
- Based on all the information presented, the committee will decide whether the student has breached the Academic Integrity Policy and the Student Code of Conduct.
- Decisions will be taken by a simple majority and will be made on the balance of probabilities, i.e. that the alleged breach is more likely to have occurred than not.
- In all cases decisions of the committee should be communicated within 5 working days.
- Where possible it is good practice to notify the student of the decision at the end of the meeting.
- Where it is not possible for the committee to come to a decision at the meeting (for example where further information is required by the committee) the outcome will be issued in writing only.
- 5.3.5. Mitigating circumstances and/or aggravating factors may be taken into account by the committee and reflected in any subsequent penalty.
- 5.3.6 The School Academic Integrity Committee may decide any of the following:
- a) That academic misconduct has not occurred; the assessment component grade will stand. No record is kept on the University's Academic Misconduct Record System.
- b) That academic misconduct has occurred. In all cases the student will receive a verbal or written warning,  be  directed  on  where  and  how  to  receive  advice  about  academic  integrity  (good writing, citation and referencing practices and avoiding plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct) and the case will be recorded in the Academic Misconduct Record System.  In addition, the committee may:
- i. Permit the student to re-submit the assessment component without academic penalty.
- ii. Permit the student to re-submit the assessment component and cap the resubmitted work.  School  Academic  Integrity  Committees may  select  the  capped  grade  from all passing grades of the Component Grading Scale as deemed appropriate.
- iii. Permit  the  student  to  resubmit  the  assessment  component  and  reduce  the  grade achieved in the resubmitted work by a specified number of grade points.

- iv. Reduce  the  grade  for  the  assessment  without  an  opportunity  to  resubmit  the assessment. School Academic Integrity Committees may select grades from all passing grades of the Component Grading Scale as deemed appropriate.
- v. Where  an  assessment  component  is  graded  as  Pass/Fail  or  where  academic misconduct occurs in a resit, School Academic Integrity Committees may apply an NM grade for assessment components and a NM (R) grade for resit attempts, or consider referral to the Student Discipline Procedure.

In cases where it is determined that plagiarism has taken place, the penalty will be guided by a University approved UCD Plagiarism Tariff.  It is noted that the UCD Plagiarism Tariff is not appropriate for guiding penalties in relation to other categories of academic misconduct, such as the unauthorised use of generative AI.

If a penalty results in a change to a grade that has already been approved by a Programme Examination Board, the Chair of the School Academic Integrity Committee should request that the  Module  Coordinator  submits  an  exceptional  change  of  grade  request  to  the  Chair  of Academic Council Committee on Examinations.

- c) Refer the alleged instance, without any decision, for resolution under the University's Student Discipline  Procedure.  In  some  contexts,  a  first  instance  may  require  direct  referral  (e.g. misconduct in single-assessment modules, second or subsequent offences or heavily weighted assessments.
- d) Decisions will be communicated to students through their UCD email address (copying the Module  Coordinator).  Where  a  decision  is  made  under  Sections  5.3.6b the communication  should  include  reference  to  their  right  to  appeal  decisions  under  specified grounds and under Student Appeals Procedure (see section 6 ).
3. 5.3.7 In all cases of referral to the University Student Discipline Procedure, the School Academic Integrity Committee should:
- a) Submit  a  Student  Misconduct  Incident  Report  Form  outlining  the  grounds  of  suspicion, reason  for  referral,  a  copy  of  the  assessment  component  and  any  supporting  evidence including minutes or summary notes to student.conduct@ucd.ie;
- b) Notify the  Module Coordinator that the alleged breach has been referred to the Student Discipline Procedure without decision;
- c) Notify  the  student  that  their  assessment  has  been  referred  for  scrutiny  as  an  alleged instance of academic misconduct under the Student Discipline Procedure 3 ; and
- d) Advise the student of the supports available to them. Where meetings are held students may choose to be accompanied by a support person of their choice, such as a Student Adviser, Students' Union representative, friend or relative.

## 5.3.8 The School Academic Integrity Committee will record incidents.

- a) The Academic Misconduct Record System is a central university system for Schools to record  incidents  of  academic  misconduct  found  by  the  School  Academic  Integrity Committee. A member of staff, nominated by the Head of School will maintain the record.
- b) Access to the system will be limited to faculty and staff with responsibility for applying the policy, administering the student discipline procedure, and maintaining the system. This will include the Chair of a School Academic Integrity Committee and the member of School staff nominated for the purpose of implementing the policy, i.e. identifying previous breaches of the  Academic  Integrity  Policy  by  students,  and  entering  decisions  of  School  Academic Integrity Committee.

3  Referrals are made without decision, therefore, the Student Appeals Procedure is not applicable and should not be referenced in communications informing students that the case has been referred to be dealt with under the

Student Discipline Procedure.  Students will be provided with the opportunity to appeal decisions made under the Student Discipline Procedure.

- c) Personal data collected and processed under the Academic Misconduct Procedures will include:  student  name  and  ID  number,  relevant  module  code,  misconduct  category, assessment type and the decision of the School Academic Integrity Committee.
