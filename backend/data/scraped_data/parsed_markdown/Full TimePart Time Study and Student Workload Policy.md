## Full Time/Part Time Study and Student Workload Policy

Version Number: 1.0

| Policy owner   | Administrative Services - UCD Registry   | Approval date and body 19   | November 2019: UMT   |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|

## 1. Purpose

Due to the change in Academic Regulations from September 2019 onwards, the distinction between student workload for Full and Part time programmes will no longer be referenced within the Academic Regulations formally. This policy outlines how decisions are made on the distinction between full time and part time study for taught programmes, based on student workload in order to maintain governance in relation to HEA, Grant confirmations and Immigration requirements which the University must report on and provide information to a number of statutory bodies for funding purposes. Graduate research programmes are defined within the Academic Regulations.

## 2. Definitions

Student Workload: Student workload is the expected amount of time that a student will need to spend on university study, including both scheduled contact time (lectures, tutorials, laboratories, workshops, etc.) and individual or group study.  Student workload in UCD is measured through the allocation of European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) credits, as set out in the Academic Regulations.

## 3. Scope

This policy sets out how the distinction between full time and part time study is determined for degree programmes for the purposes of University operations and for the purpose of reporting requirements to funding and statutory bodies. It therefore affects all taught major award programmes of the University and all students registered on taught degree programmes.

The relationship between full time and part time study for graduate research programmes and progression and completion times for such programmes is outside the scope of this policy, as these distinctions are regulated by the Academic Regulations and are overseen by Academic Council and its relevant committees.

## 4. Principles

Full time and part time study is distinguished for the following reasons:

<!-- image -->

- a)  To ensure the integrity of the data held on a student record, so that the University communicates accurately with external stakeholders.
- b)  To enable compliance with, and reporting to, funding bodies such as the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI)
- c)  To enable compliance with, and reporting to, statutory authorities, for example regarding immigration requirements.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

- 5.1 The University Management Team (UMT) define and revise parameters, based on student workload, to distinguish between full time study and part time study for the reasons outlined in section 4. The parameters, as agreed by UMT, are set out in section 6.
- 5.2 UCD Registry records and maintains a systematic record of all programmes and structures in the University.  UCD Registry is also responsible for the accurate recording of the individual student record.  This includes:
- a) updating student records when advised by relevant College or School Offices; Boards of Study, University Programme Board (UPB) and other governing boards as appropriate
- b) reporting to, and confirming information with, funding bodies and statutory authorities.
- 5.3 College &amp; School Offices' and Boards of Study responsibilities include:
- a) ensuring degree programmes they support are categorised as full time or part time in University Systems, comply structurally with UCD Academic Regulations and are in accordance with this policy;
- b) informing UCD Registry of any anomalies or required corrections affecting student records, to ensure the integrity of those records.

## 6. Parameters of student workload distinguishing full time and part time study

- 6.1 Students apply to full or part time degree programmes via the various approved entry routes, eg CAO, UCD Online Applications system etc. When students are admitted to a degree programme, they are registered to a full time or part time offering of that programme. Any change to their full time or part time registration requires the approval of the relevant governing board, in keeping with University policies and regulations
- 6.2 Students who accept a degree programme under full time or part time categorisation should remain within this for a minimum of one academic year. Exceptions to this can be made as per 6.10 below.

- 6.3 Students may withdraw from modules, as provided for under the Academic Regulations. Such withdrawal from modules does not affect whether a student is registered to a full time or part time offering of a programme.
- 6.4 The normal credit weighting for full time undergraduate degree programmes will be 60 credits in a standard academic session. The number of credits per annum may be greater or lesser than this, in accordance with the Academic Regulations.
- 6.5 The normal credit weighting for full time graduate taught degree programmes will be 90 credits in a standard academic session. The number of credits per annum may be greater or lesser than this, in accordance with the Academic Regulations.
- 6.6 The minimum credit weighting for an offering of a full time undergraduate degree programme is 40 credits per academic session and students registered to such an offering are categorised as full time students.
- 6.7 The minimum credit weighting for an offering of a full time graduate degree programme is 60 credits per academic session and students registered to such an offering are categorised as full time students.
- 6.8 The normal credit weighting for part time undergraduate degree programmes can range from 5 credits to less than 40 credits within an academic session. The number of credits per annum may be greater or lesser than this, in accordance with academic regulations
- 6.9 The normal credit weighting for part time graduate taught degree programmes can range from 5 credits to less than 60 credits within an academic session. The number of credits per annum may be greater or lesser than this, in accordance with academic regulations
- 6.10 Permission may be given to a full time student registered to a full time offer of a programme to register to lower amounts of credits from those set out in section 6.4 where this is necessary to facilitate progression and completion of a degree programme.

Table 1.0 - defines standard annual credit workload by programme.

| Programme type          | Standard annual credit load   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Full time Undergraduate | 40-60 credits                 |
| Full time Graduate      | 60-90 credits                 |
| Part time Undergraduate | 5 - <40 credits               |
| Part time Graduate      | 5 - <60 credits               |
