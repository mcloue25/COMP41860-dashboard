## Internship/Work Practice Experience: Guidelines and Good Practice ACADEMIC POLICY

Policy owner

UCD Career Development Centre

Approval date and body

Academic Council, 1 May 2014

## 1. Purpose

Professional or experiential learning has been an integral component of a number of programmes at UCD for many years. In the context of a modular credit based system there exists a requirement for an articulated statement of university-wide policy regarding what constitutes a valid internship, how such internships should be defined, monitored and assessed, the appropriate ECTS credit available for such internships, etc. This document takes account of current practice across the University and draws upon best practice in industry and different professional disciplines.

## 2. Definitions

This policy outlines a set of guidelines to support current activities and facilitate the development of future  internship  activities  at  University  College  Dublin  where  learning  takes  place  outside  the University in an experiential setting. This activity can refer to professional clinical practice placements, work experience/internships based in companies/industry and other professional fieldwork experiences  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  'internships  within  this  document).    This  policy  document  is concerned  with  arrangements  made  for  such  internship  learning  that  constitutes  a  planned  and intended part of an academic programme, is assessed by that programme and for which ECTS credit is awarded.  T his policy shall help ensure parity of practice across the University.

## 3. Scope

It should be noted that any experiential learning activities that students are required to take as part of a Programme are covered by this policy. For programmes that have yet to be modularised, the role of the Programme Board as set out in this document may be deemed to be fulfilled by the School which hosts the programme. It should be noted that this policy does not cover part-time or full-time paid work

undertaken by students under a contract of employment, nor does it cover voluntary work undertaken by students that attracts no modular credits.

## 4. Principles

This policy establishes a university-wide set of minimum standards and guidelines to be applied to all programmes that award credit for internships.

## 4.1. Academic and Professional Rationale for Internships

The  inclusion  of  an  internship  within  a  programme  should  have  a  clearly  stated  academic  and professional purpose. The overall rationale for the internship should be clearly articulated within the programmes' specified learning outcomes. It should easily demonstrate its role in advancing students' assimilation  and  application  of  knowledge.  The  definition  of  the  internship  opportunity  should  make explicit for the student the respective roles and authority of the University and the internship host. This will  normally  include  a  clear  articulation  of  the  relevant  policies  governing  students'  employment status,  code  of  conduct  arrangements,  any  financial  arrangements  and  the  applicability  of  the University's Student Code.

## 4.2. Module Design

-  The module descriptor shall specify the academic requirements for the internship in terms of the number  of  credits  to  be  awarded,  student  workload,  attendance  requirements,  duration  of internship,  expected  learning  outcomes  and  form  of  assessment  used.  Grounds  for  failure  and opportunities for remediation of that failure should be set out clearly.
-  The module descriptor may be supplemented by a specific  learning agreement which indicates specific learning outcomes associated with an internship position. Such an agreement is drawn up between  the  University,  the  student  and,  where  applicable,  the  internship  host.  In  the  case  of industrial  based  internships  (non-professional  clinical  practice)  such  a  learning  agreement  is included  as  part  of  the  'Statement  of  Internship'  which  forms  part  of  the  Internship  Agreement established  between  UCD  and  the  internship  host.    Learning  agreements  should  be  formally agreed prior to or during the first two weeks of the internship.

(The detail of the learning agreement will vary according to the overall purpose of the internship within the programme. For example, where specific learning outcomes are set out in the module descriptor,  such  as  the  achievement  of  specific  competencies,  there  may  be  no  requirement  to develop  further  individualised  learning  agreements.  However,  where  students  on  a  programme may  be  going  to  different  settings,  an  individualised  learning  agreement  will  be  helpful.  Such learning agreements should ensure that expectations for achieving the required learning outcomes are explicit and agreed between the programme, the student and, where applicable, the internship host).

-  Additional information such as regulatory information and academic guidelines for host providers offering internships, host provider requirements for Garda clearance, immunisation and health and safety requirements, etc, should be available and referred to within the module and programme descriptor. All relevant additional information should be accessible to students.
-  There should be a coherent connection between the number of learning hours expected of the student while on internship and the credit awarded. For professionally accredited programmes, the relationship  between  duration  of  internship  and  the  credit  should  also  be  in  accordance  with relevant state regulatory body guidelines, where appropriate.
-  Where a programme involves a number of short internships that, on their own, do not equate to the minimum for an undergraduate module, these internships can be combined to form a single module.
-  The number of permissible repeats of  an  internship  /professional  experience module should  be clearly stated by the Programme Board.

-  All  internships  undertaken  as mandatory integral  components of a programme must be defined within the context of the modular system (i.e. as a module or a constituent part of a module) and be described within or by an appropriate module descriptor.

## 4.3. Identification of Internships

-  The Programme Board is responsible for verifying that Schools offering  internship  modules  will make an adequate number of suitable internships available to students. Each internship should be able  to  provide  the  learning  opportunities  to  enable  students  to  meet  the  expected  learning outcomes.
-  Where  an  adequate  number  of  internships  (or  single  internships  of  adequate  duration  and challenge) cannot be arranged for the students on a programme, provision should be made for alternative learning activities, such as a project, to demonstrate that the students have broadly met the  learning  outcomes  for  the  module,  provided  this  is  compatible  with  requirements  of  the relevant regulatory professional body where such exist.
-  Where a student has a specific access need, the Programme Board should ensure that Schools offering  work  internship/practice  experience  modules  take  responsibility  for  the  provision  of    an internship that adequately meets these needs, within the constraints of the internship opportunities available to the School, provided this is compatible with requirements of the relevant regulatory professional body where such exist.
-  Where an appropriate  internship  cannot  be  arranged  for  a  student  with  specific  access  needs, provision should be made for alternative learning activities, such as a project, to demonstrate that the student has broadly met the learning outcomes for the module.
-  The Programme Board should verify that Schools offering internship/practice experience modules will  ensure  that  each  internship  meets  the  required  standard  of  support  and  supervision  for  the student.  Normally  this  will  involve  defining  and  operating  a  methodology  for  assessing  the suitability of the host provider in offering such internships.
-  In  Programmes  where  students  negotiate  the  location  of  their  own  internship,  the  programme should ensure that the standards and learning opportunities of that internship are suitable for the student's needs and/or, where relevant, are in accordance with the requirements of the relevant professional body.
-  The Programme Board should verify that Schools offering internships will ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to maintain contact with all students during the period of the internship. In  the  case  of  overseas  internships,  specific  arrangements  should  be  in  place  to  monitor  the effective operation of the internship and to offer support to the student in cases of emergency.

## 4.4. Orientation of Students

It is the responsibility of the Programme Board to verify that Schools offering internships will ensure that  all  students    complete  all  necessary  paperwork (as for example in the case of industrial based internships where students are required to sign in advance the 'student internship acceptance form'), are  fully  briefed  and  oriented  on  the  purposes  of  their  internship  experience,  the  academic  and professional requirements of the internship, their obligations under the University's Student Code, the relevant  Health  and  Safety  issues  associated  with  their  internship  and  any  other  requirements, academic or otherwise, which the Programme Board may specify, or which may be specified by the relevant regulatory professional body. In particular it is expected that the Programme Board will wish to ensure that the student understands the following:

-  Students on industrial based internships shall sign the 'Student Internship Acceptance Form; prior to commencing his/her internship.
-  Prior to the internship, students should be made aware of the person within the host provider that is their direct supervisor and the lines of authority within which they are required to operate.
-  Students  should  be  made  aware  of  the  person  who  will  be  responsible  for  assessing  their achievement of the specified learning outcomes for the internship.

-  Students  should  be  made  aware  of  any  relevant  codes  of  practice  and/or  regulations  that  are specific  to  the  host  provider  at  the  commencement  of  the  internship.    Students  are  required  to comply with such codes.
-  Where a programme operates a practice tutor system, involving UCD permanent or contract staff who monitor or visit students on internship, or staff in practice host providers whose duties include the support of students on internship, students should be made aware of the identity of the tutors and the roles of their respective practice supervisors and practice tutors in relation to internships.
-  Students should be made aware of the mechanisms for raising complaints or concerns about their internship experience.
-  A mechanism should be put in place to  allow students to communicate back to the  School,  or where  issues  are  deemed  to  be  not  satisfactorily  addressed  by  the  School  to  the  Programme Board,  any  concerns  or  complaints  about  their  experience  without  fear  of  jeopardising  their progress on the internship. Ideally, such concerns should be raised prior to the completion of the final assessment.
-  Students  need  to  have  clear  guidance  from  their  internship  supervisor  on  issues  such  as attendance, appropriate dress, time-keeping, travel arrangements and other work-place protocols.
-  Certain  host  providers  may  have  specific  requirements,  such  as  immunisation  requirements. Where such immunisation is provided for students by the programme, but declined by a student, the student needs to be aware of the limitations that this decision may place on them in regard to their internship options.  Full records of any vaccinations offered, received and/or declined must be kept by the relevant School.
-  Students  should  be  made  aware  of  the  general  requirements  to  work  and  behave  in  a  safe manner as placed upon them by relevant health and safety legislation.
-  Students should be aware that it is expected that they will uphold the same standards of conduct during internship as is required of them whilst in attendance at the University, complying with the University's Student Code and its Policy on Dignity and Respect.

## 4.5. Orientation / Agreements with  Internship Hosts

All  internships  require  a  signed  agreement  between  the  University  and  the  internship  host.  The Agreement  is  a  standard  contract  provided  by  the  University  which  should  be  signed  prior  to  the commencement  of  the  internship.  Professional  clinical  practice  placements  shall  use  the  standard UCD 'Work placement agreement'; industrial based internships shall use the standard UCD 'Internship Agreement'. In addition, it is the responsibility of the Programme Board to verify that Schools offering internships will ensure that host providers are briefed fully on the University's requirements and any specific  internship  agreements  and/or  regulations  that  relate  to  the  internship.  In  particular  the Programme Board should ensure that:

-  There is a clear articulation of the role of the internship supervisor, this may include information about their role in monitoring, managing and assessing students during internship.
-  Internship  supervisors  should  be  supported  by  the  Programme  Board  to  facilitate  them  in effectively carrying out their supervisory role.  This may involve provision of training of internship supervisors by the University.
-  Additional  supports  may  need  to  be  provided  to  internship  supervisors  in  instances  where internship difficulties have arisen.
-  Internship supervisors should have a designated point of contact for the University programme, such as the Programme Fieldwork Coordinator.
-  Before  the  start  of  an  internship,  the  host  provider  should  clearly  outline  the  health  and  safety procedures  in  place  in  the  host  provider  and  should  specify  the  health  and  safety  training  and equipment that will be given to the student.
-  In cases where students receive a payment from the  internship host, it is preferable that such a payment should come in the form of a bursary/stipend and that the student should not become an employee of the company. In cases where students do become company employees, the School should  be  satisfied  that  any  employment  contract  offered  to  students  does  not  reduce  the conditions  set  out  in  the  internship  agreement  between  the  University  and  the  internship  host (company).  Unless clearly indicated otherwise, any  intellectual property created by the student

will  remain  with  the  internship  host/company  where  the  student  becomes  an  employee  of  that company.

-  Internship supervisors are made aware that all students must receive suitable health and safety induction prior to beginning their internship, or as soon as is practicable thereafter.

## 4.6. Assessment of Internship

-  An appropriate form of assessment methodology should be agreed by the Programme Board and articulated in the module descriptor. Information on the type of award given should be included. Programme Boards must decide whether the internship will carry a specific grade (A-F) relating to performance on the internship or whether an award is made on a pass/fail basis.
-  Where internship supervisors are to undertake assessment of students they should be briefed on the  precise  expected  learning  outcomes  as  set  down  by  the  Programme  Board.  These  should include  an  understanding  of  the  nature  of  the  assessment  process,  which  will  either  verify  a student's competency or grade the level of practice performance.
-  Grounds for failure of an internship must be made explicit.
-  There  should  be  clear  articulation  of  information  relating  to  (a)  any  opportunity  to  repeat  the internship, or (b) any opportunity to remediate a failure, where that is permitted.
-  Regulations relating to an appeal against the failure of an internship must be made explicit in line with the university appeals process.
-  Any  investigation  that  may  be  required  to  assess  problems  arising  during  an  internship  will  be carried out by the institution best placed to undertake such an investigation.

## 4.7. Review and Monitoring of Internships

-  Students  and  supervisors  should  be  advised  of  the  importance  of  having  agreed  regular supervisory sessions during the course of the internship. The purpose of such sessions should be set out explicitly in any briefing documents provided to the supervisor or student.
-  For all internships, appropriate written evidence should exist in order that a student's attendance and satisfactory completion of the internship can be verified by the Programme Board.
-  The Programme Board should keep the assessment methodology for the internship under review.
-  In  internships  where  difficulties  have  been  identified,  these  difficulties  should  be  ameliorated before the setting is used again.
-  In  some  contexts,  to  ensure  the  achievement  of  specific  professional  competencies  through internship, Programme Boards may wish or need to develop and implement audit mechanisms to ensure  that  such  competencies  have  been  achieved  and  can  continue  to  be  practised  in  the longer term.

## 4.8. Obligations of the University and the Internship Host in respect of the Student

All  internships  require  a  signed  agreement  between  the  University  and  the  internship  host.  The agreement specifies the internship hosts' obligations to students and to UCD in relation to Health and Safety legislation. This contract will be separate to any individual learning agreement drawn up to deal with  students'  learning  needs,  etc.  In  the  case  of  the  Internship  Agreement,  as  used  for  industrial based internships, the main body of the Internship  Agreement is standard  wording applicable to  all such internships.  However, the basic form of the 'Statement of Internship' which is attached as an appendix must be completed for each student individually. As explained in Section 3.2 the details of the 'Statement of Internship' will vary according to the conditions offered by the internship host and the overall purpose of the internship within the programme.

## 4.9. Supplementary Guides/Code Subject Specific

Programmes may establish supplementary guidelines to provide detailed information relating to the required learning objectives of an internship. This may include documentation for either the student or supervisor to keep a record of progress during internships.
