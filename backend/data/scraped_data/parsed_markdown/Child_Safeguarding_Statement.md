The  Child  Protection  Officer 2  is  responsible  for  reporting  the matter  to  Tusla  and/or  An  Garda  Síochána,  while the  Director  of  Human Resources  or  his/her  nominee  is  responsible  for  addressing  the  relevant procedural issues applicable in respect of a University staff member.

## 8.3. Allegations of child abuse against a student member of the University

- 8.3.1. If an allegation is made against a student member of the University, action should be guided by the 2015 Act, the 2017 Guidance, the agreed procedures under the University Student Code and the rules of natural justice.
- 8.3.2. The Child Protection Officer should be informed as soon as possible.
- 8.3.3. The first priority should be to ensure that no child is exposed to unnecessary risk. The Child Protection Officer shall, as a matter of urgency, refer the matter to the Registrar 3 who may take any necessary protective measures. These measures should be proportionate to the level of  risk  and  should  not  unduly  penalise  the  student  member,  unless  necessary  to  protect children.
- 8.3.4. Any allegation of abuse must be dealt with sensitively and with a presumption of innocence (until the contrary is proved) and the University student member should be treated fairly. This includes the right not to be judged in advance of a full and fair enquiry. The Child Protection Officer should privately advise the person against whom the allegation of child abuse is being made of the following;
- 8.3.4.1  The fact that an allegation has been made against him/her; and
- 8.3.4.2   The available details of the nature of the allegation.
- 8.3.5. The University student member should be afforded the opportunity to respond to the Child Protection Officer (rather than the Person making the allegation). The Child Protection Officer should note the response and pass the information on to Tusla, if making a formal report.
- 8.3.6. A follow up of allegations of abuse against a University student member should be made in consultation with Tusla and/or An Garda Síochána. Immediate contact should be made with these two agencies for that purpose.
- 8.3.7. It is important to note that if an allegation is made against student member of the University, then there are two procedures to be followed:
- 8.3.7.1 dealing with the matter in accordance with the University Student Code; and
- 8.3.7.2 reporting the allegation in accordance with sections 9.3 and 9.4 of this CSS, to Tusla and An Garda Síochána.

2 Or the Child Protection Officer and MP acting jointly

3 Or his/her nominee

- 8.3.8. In  general,  the  same  person  should  not  have  the  responsibility  of  dealing  with  both procedures. The Child Protection Officer 4 is responsible for reporting the matter to Tusla and/or An Garda Síochána, while the Registrar is responsible for addressing the application of the University's Student Code, if relevant.
- 8.3.9. It should be further noted that in the event that an allegation is made against a student who is under 18 years of age, this should be considered a child welfare and protection issue for both children and the Child Protection Officer should follow the outlined procedures for both the alleged victim and the alleged abuser. For further details, please see Appendix 1 of this CSS in relation to the signs and symptoms of abuse/bullying.

## 9. Reporting Framework

## 9.1. Guiding Principles

- 9.1.1 The guiding principles on reporting child abuse or neglect may be summarised as follows:
- 9.1.1.1.1 The safety and well-being of the child must take priority over concerns about adults against whom an allegation may be made; and
- 9.1.1.1.2 Reports should be made immediately to Tusla in accordance with this CSS.
- 9.1.2 Child abuse can be categorised into four different types: (i) neglect, (ii) emotional abuse, (iii) physical abuse and (iv) sexual abuse. A child may be subjected to one or more forms of abuse at any given time. Abuse and neglect can occur within the family, in the community or in an institutional setting. The abuser may be someone known to the child or a stranger, and can be an adult or another child. In a situation where abuse is alleged to have been carried out by

another child, it is a child welfare and protection issue for both children and child protection procedures should be followed for both the victim and the alleged abuser.

- 9.1.3 The important factor in deciding whether the behaviour is abuse or neglect is the impact of that behaviour on the child rather than the intention of the parent/guardian.
- 9.1.4 Please refer to Appendix 1 of this CSS for further information on recognising the signs and symptoms of child abuse/neglect.

## 9.2. Mandated and Non-Mandated Reporting

- 9.2.1. There are two instances of reporting to Tusla:
- 9.2.1.1 Mandated reporting; and
- 9.2.1.2 Non-mandated reporting/Reporting of reasonable concerns
- 9.2.2 Where University members, including MPs, know, believe or have reasonable grounds to suspect that a child may have been abused or neglected, is being abused or neglected, or is at risk of abuse or neglect, he/she shall without delay report this to the Child Protection Officer
- 9.2.3 When such a report is made to the Child Protection Officer, s/he 5 should consider whether this is a mandated or non-mandated concern.

## 9.3. Mandated Reporting

## 9.3.1. In accordance with section 14 of the 2015 Act,

- 9.3.1.1 where an MP knows, believes or has reasonable grounds to suspect, on the basis of information that he or she has received, acquired or become aware of in the course of his or her employment or profession as such a mandated person, that a child has been harmed, is being harmed, or is at risk of being harmed; s/he shall as soon as practicable, report that knowledge, belief or suspicion to Tusla
- 9.3.1.2 Where a child believes that s/he has been harmed, is being harmed, or is at risk of being  harmed  and  discloses  that  belief  to  an  MP  in  the  course  of  the  MP's employment or profession, the MP shall report that disclosure to Tusla
- 9.3.2. Where an MP has the knowledge, belief or suspicion outlined at (i) above and/or receives a disclosure from a child in accordance with (ii) above, s/he shall without delay, report this to the Child Protection Officer.
- 9.3.3. Where the Child Protection Officer and the MP both agree that there are reasonable grounds for concern,  the  Child  Protection  Officer  and  MP  must  jointly  consider  whether  the  concern  in question is at or above the defined threshold of harm at which point a report must be submitted as a mandated report to Tusla.
- 9.3.4. Where the Child Protection Officer and/or the MP are unsure whether the concern meets the threshold for making a mandated report, the Child Protection Officer shall seek advice from Tusla. The Child Protection Officer shall inform the MP concerned that such advice is being sought and shall inform the MP of the advice once same has been provided.
- 9.3.5. Where Tusla advises that a mandated report should be made, the Child Protection Officer and the MP shall act on that advice and a mandated report shall be submitted to Tusla jointly by the Child Protection Officer and MP as soon as practicable.
- 9.3.6. Where a mandated concern requires urgent intervention to make the child safe, section 14(7) of the 2015 Act allows the Child Protection Officer/MP to alert Tusla of the concern in advance of  submitting  a  written  report.  Subsequently,  the  MP  and  the  Child  Protection  Officer  must jointly submit a mandated report to Tusla on the report form at Appendix 7A within three days.

5 Or the DLP and MP acting jointly.

- 9.3.7. Where the Child Protection Officer does not believe the concern satisfies the threshold of harm sufficient to submit a mandatory report, s/he should inform the MP in writing that if s/he remains concerned, the MP, may submit a mandated report to Tusla. In these circumstances, the MP must furnish the Child Protection Officer with a copy of the mandated report s/he provided to Tusla and inform the Child Protection Officer of any advice, information and/or documentation s/he receives from Tusla in relation to the report.
- 9.3.8. The thresholds of harm for each category of abuse at which MPs have a legal obligation to make mandated reports are as follows:

## 9.3.8.1 Neglect

The threshold of harm at which an MP must make a mandated report to Tusla is reached when s/he knows, believes or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child's needs have been neglected, are being neglected, or are at risk of being neglected to the point where the child's health, development or welfare have been or are being seriously affected, or are likely to be seriously affected.

## 9.3.8.2 Emotional Abuse/Ill-Treatment

The threshold of harm, at which an MP must made a mandated report to Tusla is reached when s/he knows, believes or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child has been, is being, or is at risk of being ill-treated to the point where the child's health, development or welfare have been or are being seriously affected, or are likely to be seriously affected.

## 9.3.8.3 Physical Abuse

The threshold of harm, at which an MP must make a mandated report to Tusla is reached when s/he knows, believes or has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child has been, is being, or is at risk of being assaulted and that as a result the child's health, development or welfare have been or are being seriously affected, or are likely to be seriously affected.

## 9.3.8.4 Sexual Abuse

A threshold does not apply as all sexual abuse falls within the category of seriously affecting a  child's  health,  welfare  or  development.  If  an  MP  knows,  believes  or  has  reasonable grounds to suspect that a child has been, is being, or is at risk of being sexually abused, then the MP must make a mandated report to Tusla. Sexual abuse is an offence against the  child  as  specified  in  Schedule  3  of  the  2015  Act,  this  schedule  is  reproduced  in Appendix 3 of this CSS.

There is one exception to the requirement to report sexual abuse i.e. certain consensual sexual  activity  between  teenagers,  as  provided  for  in  the  2015  Act  and  as  outlined  at Appendix 3A of this CSS.

## 9.3.9. No obligation to submit a mandated report

## 9.3.9.1 There is no obligation to make a mandated report where:

- i. the concern relates to consensual sexual activity as per Appendix 3A of this CSS and as defined at section 14(3) of the 2015 Act;
- ii. the sole basis for the MP's knowledge, belief or suspicion of harm is as a result of information s/he has acquired, received or become aware of from:
3. o Another MP, who has made a report to Tusla,
4. o A person, other than an MP, who has reported jointly with an MP to Tusla,

unless an MP becomes aware of any additional information, in which case a further report should be made to Tusla;

- iii. information was received by the MP pursuant to his or her role in assisting Tusla with an assessment as to whether a child who is the subject of a report or any other child

has been, is being or is at risk of being harmed; or

- iv. information is acquired by an MP outside the course of his/her professional work or employment on the basis of a personal rather than a professional relationship.

The foregoing exemptions do not apply to a disclosure made by a child to an MP.

## 9.3.10. Failure to make a mandated report

- 9.3.10.1 MPs  should  be  aware  of  the  administrative  actions  that  Tusla  can  take  if,  after  an investigation, it emerges that an MP failed to make a mandated report. Tusla may:

i. make a complaint to the Fitness to Practise Committee of a regulatory body of which the MP in question is a member; or

- ii. pass information about the MP's failure to make a report to the National Vetting Bureau of An Garda Síochána. This information could then be disclosed to an MP's current or future employers when s/he is next vetted.
2. 9.3.10.2 The University will treat a failure to make a mandated report as a disciplinary matter, which will be dealt with under the relevant disciplinary procedure.
3. 9.3.10.3 In addition, the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 requires that any person who has information about an offence 6 against a child, which may result in charges or prosecution, must report this to An Garda Síochána. Failure to report is a criminal offence.
4. 9.3.10.4 An MP cannot submit a mandated report anonymously.

## 9.4. Non-Mandated Reporting

## 9.4.1. Reasonable concerns below the threshold

- 9.4.1.1 If an MP receives an allegation or has a suspicion that a child may have been abused or neglected, is being abused or neglected, or is at risk of abuse or neglect, he/she shall, without delay, report this to the Child Protection Officer.
- 9.4.1.2 Where both the Child Protection Officer and MP decide that the concern does not reach the threshold for mandated reporting, but there remains a reasonable concern about the welfare or protection of a child, the Child Protection Officer is required to report this to Tusla. If the Child Protection Officer is unsure whether the matter should be reported, s/he shall take advice from Tusla and act on this advice.

## 9.4.2. Concerns from NMPs

- 9.3.2.1 Where a NMP has a concern in relation to child abuse or neglect, the NMP should report this to the Child Protection Officer. In light of the information received, the Child Protection Officer will decide whether to report the matter to Tusla and/or seek informal advice.

## 9.4.3. Seeking informal advice from Tusla

- 9.4.3.1 Where the Child Protection Officer and/or an MP is concerned about a child but is unsure whether to report the concern to Tusla, or whether a report should be submitted to Tusla as  a  mandated  report,  the  Child  Protection  Officer  shall  seek  advice  from  Tusla.  In consulting Tusla, the Child Protection Officer shall be explicit that he or she is requesting advice and consultation and that he or she is not making a report. At this informal stage, the Child Protection Officer need not give identifying details.
- 9.4.3.2 It should be noted that if the concern was brought to the attention of the Child Protection Officer by an MP, the Child Protection Officer shall inform the MP that Tusla's advice is being sought and shall inform the MP of the advice when received.

6 These offences are set out in Appendix 8

- 9.4.3.3 If Tusla advise that a report should be made to it, the Child Protection Officer should act on that advice.
- 9.4.3.4 In all cases where the Child Protection Officer has sought the advice of Tusla, the Child Protection Officer shall retain a record of the consultation, which will note the date, the name of the Tusla official and the advice given.

## 9.4.4. Where the Child Protection Officer does not report the matter to Tusla

- 9.4.4.1 If the Child Protection Officer decides not to report a matter to Tusla, the matter should still be recorded or noted internally by the Child Protection Officer.
- 9.4.4.2 If the Child Protection Officer decides not to report a concern to Tusla, the following steps should be taken:
- i. The reasons for not reporting should be recorded;
- ii. Any actions taken as a result of the concern should be recorded;
- iii. The  Child  Protection  Officer  must  provide  the  employee/volunteer  with  a  clear  written explanation of the reason why the Child Protection Officer decided not to report;
- iv. The Child Protection Officer must inform the  employee or volunteer who raised the concern that  it  is  open  to  him  her  to  seek  informal  advice  from  Tusla  and/or  to  report  his/her concern where s/he still considers that such a report is warranted and/or report the matter to An Garda Síochána; and
- v. In such circumstances, the MP must provide a copy of the report to the Child Protection Officer.

## 9.5. Disclosure of suspected child abuse by a child to a University Member

- 9.5.1. If a complaint of abuse is disclosed directly from a child to a University member, the child is likely to be under severe emotional stress and the University member may be the only adult whom the child is prepared to trust. Great care should be taken not to damage trust and deal with disclosures sensitively and professionally. The following approach is suggested as best practice for dealing with these disclosures.
- 9.5.1.1 React calmly;
- 9.5.1.2 Listen carefully and attentively;
- 9.5.1.3 Take the child seriously;
- 9.5.1.4 Reassure the child that they have taken the right action in talking to you;
- 9.5.1.5 Do not promise to keep anything secret;
- 9.5.1.6 Ask questions for clarification only;
- 9.5.1.7 Do not ask leading questions;
- 9.5.1.8 Check back with the child that what you have heard is correct and understood;
- 9.5.1.9 Do not express any opinions about the alleged abuser;
- 9.5.1.10 Ensure that the child understands the procedures that will follow;
- 9.5.1.11 Make a written record of the conversation as soon as possible, in as much detail as possible, using the actual words that the child used;

- 9.5.1.12 Treat the information confidentially, subject to the requirements of this CSS, legislation and the 2017 Guidance.
- 9.5.2. If child abuse is suspected, or an allegation is made, the University member should:
- 9.5.2.1 insofar as is appropriate gather information;
- 9.5.2.2 record the conversation (in the words of the child) and their observations accurately. The observations  should  include  dates,  times,  names,  locations,  context  and  any  other information that may be relevant;
- 9.5.2.3 inform the Child Protection Officer as soon as possible; and
- 9.5.2.4 the University member should not interview the child or the child's parents/guardian about the alleged abuse, as this is the function of Tusla and/or An Garda Síochána. The role of the University member is not to investigate.

## 9.6. Allegations of Child Abuse on Placement

- 9.6.1 University  staff,  when  arranging  work  placements,  must  clarify  the  child  safeguarding procedures  within  the  host  organisations.  The  University's  students  must  familiarise themselves with these procedures.
- 9.6.2 If a University member has a child protection concern while on work placement, then the University member should follow the procedure for reporting child protection concerns in the organisation in which the work placement is taking place. If the University member is unclear of the procedure, s/he should contact the Child Protection Officer for clarification.
- 9.6.3 If  an  allegation  of  child  abuse  is  made  against  a  University  member  while  on  work placement, the procedure to be followed is as per this CSS, as outlined above. Where a University member becomes aware of allegations of child abuse or neglect, he/she must contact  the  Child  Protection  Officer  immediately  who  will  liaise  with  the  RP  within  the organisation where the work placement is taking place.

## 9.7. Disclosure of suspected child abuse by a third party to a University Member

- 9.7.1. If a complaint is made to a University member from either another University member or a third party, to the effect that there is reasonable suspicion that abuse or neglect is alleged to have taken place against a child, the University member should:
- 9.7.1.1 direct the person to the Child Protection Officer to report the concern; or
- 9.7.1.2 report the concern to the Child Protection Officer him/herself;
- 9.7.2. If the disclosure is made to an MP, s/he may have a statutory obligation to report to Tusla, this should be done in accordance with this CSS.

## 9.8. Child Pornography

- 9.8.1 Knowingly  producing,  distributing,  printing,  publishing  or  showing  child  pornography  or possessing  it  for  any  of  these  purposes  is  a  criminal  offence  under  Child  Trafficking  and Pornography Act 1998. In order to combat child grooming and similar behaviour, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 2017 makes it a criminal offence for a person to send sexually explicit material by means of information and communication technology to a child.
- 9.8.2 If  a  University  member  is  concerned  that  child  pornography  images  are  being  downloaded and/or viewed , this should be reported as soon as possible to the Child Protection Officer. The Child  Protection  Officer  is  then  responsible  for  ensuring  that  suspicions  or  allegations are referred to the Gardaí/Tusla and managed as per this CSS. If the University Member is an MP, s/he may have a statutory obligation to report to Tusla, if applicable, this should be done in accordance with the joint reporting procedures in  this CSS.

## 9.9. MPs who work with adults

Where a University employee works with or treats persons, during the course of his/her employment, with mental health difficulties, intellectual disability, addiction or domestic violence issues, s/he must consider the welfare and safety of any children in that person's family and/or children in regular contact with the person. If there are concerns, which meet or exceed the thresholds outlined above, then s/he must  report  them  jointly  with  the  Child  Protection  Officer  to  Tusla  in  accordance  with  this  CSS. Reasonable concerns below that threshold should also be reported to the Child Protection Officer who will report it to Tusla in accordance with this CSS.

## 9.10. Retrospective disclosure of child abuse by an adult

- 9.10.1 Some adults may disclose abuse that took place during their childhood. Such disclosures may come to light in various ways such as when a student attends an MP who works as a Student Counsellor  or  Student  Healthcare  professional.  Such  a  disclosure  may  require  mandated reporting as set out above. In accordance with professional obligations, an MP will endeavour to establish whether there is any current risk to any child who may be in contact with the alleged abuser revealed in such disclosures.
- 9.10.2 Where an MP provides counselling, it is recommended that students are put on notice before the counselling starts, that if any child protection issues arise and the alleged perpetrator is identifiable, the MP must pass the information on to Tusla. If the student does not feel able to participate in any investigation, Tusla may be seriously constrained in their ability to respond to the retrospective allegation.
- 9.10.3 Any reasonable concern about past abuse, where the information came to attention before the 2015 Act came into force and where there is a possible continuing risk to children, should be reported in accordance with the non-mandated reporting procedures outlined in section 9.4 of this CSS.
- 9.10.4 If  a  University  member  makes a disclosure of abuse suffered during his/her childhood, the person to whom s/he has made the disclosure should provide him/her with contact information for the relevant University support services; a student should be provided with contact details for the Universities Counselling Services. The University staff member should be provided with details of the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) service. https://www.ucd.ie/hr/benefitsforfacultyandstaff/staffsupportsandnetworks/. Reports in relation to retrospective abuse can be made by submitting the Tusla form attached at Appendix 7B of this CSS.

## 9.11. Internal Oversight

- 9.11.1. The Child Protection Officer shall inform the appropriate University Officer of mandated and nonmandated reports made by a University member. The appropriate University Officer will be:
- 9.11.1.1 The Registrar where the allegation is made against a University student, and
- 9.11.1.2 the  Director  of  Human  Resources  where  the  allegation  is  made  against  a  University employee or an individual working on a voluntary/unpaid basis on behalf of the University or any other person,
- 9.11.1.3 the University President where the allegation is made in relation to any other case.

Each of whom will be sensitive to the fact that information should only be shared on a need to know basis with those with a right or a need to know.

## 9.12. Protection from Civil Liability

- 9.12.1 Where the Child Protection Officer or any other person reports suspicions of child abuse and neglect 'reasonably and in good faith' to designated officers of Tusla or any members of An Garda Síochána, the Protection of Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 ( the ' 1998 Act ') protects them from civil liability for doing so. This means that if a person makes a report of suspected child abuse to Tusla or to An Garda Síochána even if it proves unfounded, any person taking  an  action  would  only  be  successful  if  they  could  prove  the  person  had  not  acted reasonably and in good faith in making the report. That 1998 Act also makes it an offence to make a report  of  child  abuse  to  the  appropriate  authorities  'knowing  the  statement  to  be untrue'. This is designed to protect innocent persons from malicious reports.

## 9.13 False and mistaken allegations

- 9.13.1 It is important that when an allegation is found to be false or mistaken that all   appropriate steps are taken to restore the good name of the person wrongly accused. The  Child Protection Officer shall liaise with appropriate colleagues (including the Registrar, the Director of Human Resources and the University's legal team) and they shall decide on how the accused person is to be supported and facilitated in resuming his/her functions.
- 9.13.2 When the Child Protection Officer is satisfied immediately that it would have been impossible for  the  person  complained  of  to  have  committed  the  abuse,  for  instance,  it  can  be  clearly established that they were elsewhere at the time of the alleged complaint s/he will:
- i. Advise the complainant in writing of the action being taken and its outcome, including information on other avenues to pursue the matter if s/he remains dissatisfied;
- ii. Advise the person against whom the complaint has been made, providing details and confirming that it is without substance and that no further action is being taken;
- iii. Consider whether the complainant has been abused by someone else and report the matter to Tusla /Gardaí;
- iv. Keep a comprehensive record of the incident, including the reason for no further action; and
- v. Consider initiating a complaint of knowingly making a false report of child abuse under the provisions of Section 5 of the 1998 Act.

## 10. Research Activities involving children - Best Practice

- 10.1. Research involving children must be approved by the University's research ethics process prior to the commencement of the work. General information on research ethics applications can be obtained from the University's Research Ethics Committee. When working with children, the researcher must comply with this CSS and the University's Code of Good Practice in Research and all policies and guidelines of  the  University's  Human Research Ethics Committee including, but not limited to, the policy on 'Vulnerable Groups' and 'Research  with Students who are a Minor.'

In particular, the following must be complied with:

- 10.1.1. In relation to research which has required approval from the Ethics Committee written consent must  be  obtained  from  the  parents/guardians  of  children  under  18  years  and  (where appropriate, i.e. where the children are capable of providing informed consent) from the children themselves.
- 10.1.2. In assessing whether the child is capable of giving informed consent, their age, literacy, cultural background and any learning difficulties or disabilities should be taken into account.
- 10.1.3. Children need to be informed in appropriate language so that they understand the research in which they are being asked to participate.
- 10.1.4. The effect of the research on the child is monitored to ensure that the child feels comfortable with continuing with the research. A child's right to discontinue participation must be respected.
- 10.1.5. There may be occasions when a confidential interview or a one-to-one meeting is necessary and in such circumstances, the interview should be conducted in a room with an open door or visual access.
- 10.1.6. Assurances of complete confidentiality must not be given.
- 10.2. In situations where research involves children who are or have been in state care, such children and their care proceedings are governed by 'in camera' rules and principles of confidentiality, as set out in section 29 and section 31 of the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended). Legal advice should always be sought in advance of undertaking such research.

## 11. Confidentiality &amp; Record Keeping

## 11.1. Sharing of Information

- 11.1.1 No  undertakings  regarding  secrecy  can  be  given  by  any  University  member  to  the  person reporting an allegation of child abuse, be they an adult or a child. This should be made clear to all parties involved, although reassurances can be given that all information will be handled with sensitivity, taking full account of legal requirements.
- 11.1.2 All information regarding concerns of child abuse or neglect should be shared on a 'need to know' basis only i.e. with personnel who have a legitimate involvement or role in dealing with the issue.  Giving information reasonably and in good faith to those who need to have the information for the protection of a child who may have been or is in danger of being abused (including  the  Child  Protection  Officer,  Tusla  or  An  Garda  Síochána)  is  not  a  breach  of confidentiality or data protection laws.
- 11.1.3 At  all  stages  in  the  process  (disclosure,  reporting  and  dealing  with  an  abuse  allegation), confidentiality is of extreme importance. Statements, letters and other communications shall be confidential to those involved as per the procedure outlined in this CSS.
- 11.1.4 In accordance with section 17 of the 2015 Act, where the Child Protection Officer and/or MP is assisting Tusla to carry out an assessment, s/he may not share this information with a third party save in accordance with the law, or unless Tusla authorises in writing the disclosure of information, subject to such conditions (if any) as Tusla considers appropriate and specifies in the authorisation. A person who fails to comply with this requirement shall be guilty of a criminal offence.

## 11.2. Management of records

- 11.2.1 All records of allegations in relation to child protection issues, which are made to a University member,  should  be  regarded  as  highly  confidential  and  should  be  provided  to  the  Child Protection Officer and stored in a secure location, in keeping with Data Protection requirements.

## 11.3. Record Keeping/Recording Allegations

- 11.3.1 Where there is an allegation of child abuse or neglect, the Child Protection Officer shall keep proper dated and signed records. All records are highly confidential and it is the responsibility of the Child Protection Officer to ensure that these are kept securely.
- 11.3.2 Details of allegations and reports of alleged incidents of abuse must be recorded.  The records include:
- 11.3.2.1 the date and time of disclosure;
- 11.3.2.2 details of the allegation;
- 11.3.2.3 details of what action the University has taken;
- 11.3.2.4 an indication of the parties involved (including third parties) including names and addresses;
- 11.3.2.5 any suspicions consequent on the information and the factual grounds for such suspicions;
- 11.3.2.6 the response of the parents/guardians to the information (if any);
- 11.3.2.7 the response of the person against whom the allegations were made (if any);
- 11.3.2.8 the  report  from  the  University  staff  member  who  received  the  information  or  who  has concerns;
- 11.3.2.9 where a decision is made not to inform the parents/guardians, the reason for the decision and the advice received from Tusla;
- 11.3.2.10 details (dates, times, people, place) of any subsequent meetings and communications of interested parties; and

- 11.3.2.11 decisions re referral (or not) to Tusla, or An Garda Síochána including how, why, when and by whom the decision was taken.

## 12. Other Considerations

## 12.1. Informing The Child's Parent(s)/Guardian(s) That A Report Is Being Made

- 12.1.1. The 2017 Guidance outlines that it is good practice to inform the parent/guardian that a report concerning his or her child is being made and the reasons for the decision to make the report. It is not necessary to inform a parent/guardian that a report is being made -
- 12.1.1.1 if by doing so, the child will be placed at further risk; or
- 12.1.1.2 in cases where the family's knowledge of the report could impair Tusla's ability to carry out a risk assessment; or
- 12.1.1.3 if the reporter is of the reasonable opinion that by doing so it may place him/her at risk of harm from the family.
- 12.1.2. Accordingly, when the Child Protection Officer is submitting a report to Tusla, he/she should inform a parent/guardian that a report is being made and the reasons for the decision to report except where any of the conditions at (1) to (3) above apply. In any case, where an MP is submitting a report to Tusla, the Child Protection Officer, rather than the MP concerned, shall assume the responsibility for informing the parent/guardian.
- 12.1.3. A record shall be made of the information communicated by the Child Protection Officer to the parent/guardian. A decision by the Child Protection Officer not to inform a parent/guardian shall be recorded together with the reasons for not doing so.
- 12.1.4. Where the Child Protection Officer has any doubt as to whether to inform a parent/guardian that a report is being made, the Child Protection Officer shall seek the advice of Tusla.

## 13. Implementation &amp; Review

- 13.1.1 The  University  recognises  that  implementation  is  an  on-going  process.  The  University  is committed to the implementation of this CSS, which supports its intention to keep children safe from harm while availing of its services.
- 13.1.2 This CSS will be reviewed on or before March 10 th  2024, or as soon as practicable after there has been a material change in any matter to which the statement refers.

## APPENDIX 1 - SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CHILD ABUSE

This is an extract from Chapter 2 the 2017 Guidance.

## Signs and symptoms of neglect

Child neglect is the most frequently reported category of abuse, both in Ireland and internationally. Ongoing chronic neglect is recognised as being extremely harmful to the development and well-being of the child and may have serious long-term negative consequences. Neglect occurs when a child does not receive adequate care or supervision to the extent that the child is harmed physically or developmentally. It is generally defined in terms of an omission of care, where a child's health, development or welfare is impaired by being deprived of food, clothing, warmth, hygiene, medical care, intellectual stimulation or supervision and safety. Emotional neglect may also lead to the child having attachment difficulties. The extent of the damage to the child's health, development or welfare is influenced by a range of factors. These factors include the extent, if any, of positive influence in the child's life as well as the age of the child and the frequency and consistency of neglect.

Neglect is associated with poverty but not necessarily caused by it. It is strongly linked to parental substance misuse, domestic violence, and parental mental illness  and  disability.  A  reasonable  concern  for  the  child's welfare would exist when neglect becomes typical of the relationship between the child and the parent or carer. This may become apparent where the University member sees the child over a period of time, or the effects of neglect may be obvious based on having seen the child once.

## Characteristics of neglect

The following are features of child neglect:

- Children being left alone without adequate care and supervision
- Malnourishment, lacking food, unsuitable food or erratic feeding
- Non-organic failure to thrive, i.e. a child not gaining weight due not only to malnutrition but also emotional deprivation
- Failure to provide adequate care for the child's medical and developmental needs, including intellectual stimulation
- Inadequate  living  conditions  -  unhygienic  conditions,  environmental  issues,  including  lack  of  adequate heating and furniture
- Lack of adequate clothing
- Inattention to basic hygiene
- Lack of protection and exposure to danger, including moral danger, or lack of supervision appropriate to the child's age
- Persistent failure to attend school
- Abandonment or desertion

## Signs and symptoms of emotional abuse

Emotional abuse is the systematic emotional or psychological ill-treatment of a child as part of the overall relationship between a caregiver and a child. Once-off and occasional difficulties between a parent/carer and child  are  not  considered  emotional  abuse.  Abuse  occurs  when  a  child's  basic  need  for  attention,  affection, approval, consistency and security are not met, due to incapacity or indifference from their parent or caregiver. Emotional abuse can also occur when adults responsible for taking care of children are unaware of and unable (for a range of reasons) to meet their children's emotional and developmental needs. Emotional abuse is not easy to recognise because the effects are not easily seen. A reasonable concern for the child's welfare would exist when the behaviour becomes typical of the relationship between the child and the parent or carer.

## Characteristics of emotional abuse

Emotional abuse may be seen in some of the following ways:

- Rejection
- Lack of comfort and love
- Lack of attachment
- Lack of proper stimulation (e.g. fun and play)
- Lack of continuity of care (e.g. frequent moves, particularly unplanned)
- Continuous lack of praise and encouragement
- Persistent criticism, sarcasm, hostility or blaming of the child
- Bullying
- Conditional parenting in which care or affection of a child depends on his or her behaviours or  actions
- Extreme overprotectiveness
- Inappropriate non-physical punishment (e.g. locking child in bedroom)
- Ongoing family conflicts and family violence
- Seriously inappropriate expectations of a child relative to his/her age and stage of development

There may be no physical signs of emotional abuse unless it occurs with another type of abuse. A child may show signs  of  emotional  abuse  through  their  actions  or  emotions  in  several  ways.  These  include  insecure attachment, unhappiness, low self-esteem, educational and developmental underachievement, risk taking and aggressive behaviour.

It should be noted that no one indicator is conclusive evidence of emotional abuse. Emotional abuse is more likely to impact negatively on a child where it is persistent over time and where there is a lack of other protective factors.

## Signs and symptoms of physical abuse

Physical abuse is when someone deliberately hurts a child physically or puts them at risk of being physically hurt. It may occur as a single incident or as a pattern of incidents. A reasonable concern exists where the child's health and/ or development is, may be, or has been damaged as a result of suspected physical abuse.

Physical abuse can include the following:

- Physical punishment
- Beating, slapping, hitting or kicking
- Pushing, shaking or throwing
- Pinching, biting, choking or hair-pulling
- Use of excessive force in handling

The 2015 Act includes a provision that abolishes the common law defence of reasonable chastisement in court proceedings. This defence could previously be invoked by a parent or other person in authority who physically disciplined a child. The change in the legislation now means that in prosecutions relating to assault or physical cruelty,  a  person  who  administers  such  punishment  to  a  child  cannot  rely  on  the  defence  of  reasonable chastisement in the legal proceedings. The result of this is that the protections in law relating to assault now apply to a child in the same way as they do to an adult.

## Signs and symptoms of sexual abuse

Sexual abuse occurs when a child is used by another person for his or her gratification or arousal, or for that of others. It includes the child being involved in sexual acts (masturbation, fondling, oral or penetrative sex) or exposing the child to sexual activity directly or through pornography. Child sexual abuse may cover a wide spectrum of abusive activities. It rarely involves just a single incident and in some instances occurs over a number of years. Child sexual abuse most commonly happens within the family, including older siblings and extended family members. Cases of sexual abuse mainly come to light through disclosure by the child or his or her siblings/friends, from the suspicions of an adult, and/or by physical symptoms.

Examples of child sexual abuse include the following:

- Any sexual act intentionally performed in the presence of a child
- Deliberate poisoning
- Suffocation
- Fabricated/induced illness
- Female genital mutilation

- An invitation to sexual touching or intentional touching or molesting of a child's body whether by a person or object for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification
- Masturbation in the presence of a child or the involvement of a child in an act of masturbation
- Sexual intercourse with a child, whether oral, vaginal or anal
- Sexual exploitation of a child, which includes:
- Ø Inviting, inducing or coercing a child to engage in prostitution or the production of child pornography [for example, exhibition, modelling or posing for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification or sexual act, including its recording (on film, videotape or other media) or the manipulation, for those purposes, of an image by computer or other means]
- Ø Inviting, coercing or inducing a child to participate in, or to observe, any sexual, indecent or obscene act
- Ø Showing sexually explicit material to children, which is often a feature of the 'grooming' process by perpetrators of abuse
- Exposing a child to inappropriate or abusive material through information and communication technology
- Consensual sexual activity involving an adult and an underage person

An Garda Síochána will deal with any criminal aspects of a sexual abuse case under the relevant criminal justice legislation. The prosecution of a sexual offence against a child will be considered within the wider objective of child welfare and protection. The safety of the child is paramount and at no stage should a child's safety be compromised because of concern for the integrity of a criminal investigation.

In relation to child sexual abuse, it should be noted that in criminal law the age of consent to sexual intercourse is 17 years for both boys and girls. Any sexual relationship where one or both parties are under the age of 17 is  illegal.  However,  it  may  not  necessarily  be  regarded  as  child  sexual  abuse.  Details  on  exemptions  for mandated reporting of certain cases of underage consensual sexual activity can be found in Appendix 3A of this CSS.

## Circumstances which may make children more vulnerable to harm

If the University member is dealing with children, s/he needs to be alert to the possibility that a welfare or protection concern may arise in relation to children s/he comes into contact with. A child needs to have someone they can trust in order to feel able to disclose abuse they may be experiencing. They need to know that they will be believed and will get the help they need. Without these things, they may be vulnerable to continuing abuse.

Some  children  may  be  more  vulnerable  to  abuse  than  others.  Also,  there  may  be  particular  times  or circumstances  when  a  child  may  be  more  vulnerable  to  abuse  in  their  lives.  In  particular,  children  with disabilities, children with communication difficulties, children in care or living away from home, or children with a parent or parents with problems in their own lives may be more susceptible to harm.

The following list is intended to help identify the range of issues in a child's life that may place them at greater risk of abuse or neglect. It is important to remember that the presence of any of these factors does not necessarily mean that a child in those circumstances or settings is being abused.

## Parent or carer factors:

- Ø Drug and alcohol misuse
- Ø Addiction, including gambling
- Ø Mental health issues
- Ø Parental disability issues, including learning or intellectual disability

## Child factors:

- Ø Age
- Ø Gender
- Ø Sexuality
- Ø Disability
- Ø Mental health issues, including selfharm and suicide
- Ø Conflictual relationships

## Community factors:

- Ø Cultural, ethnic, religious or faith-based norms in the family or community which may not meet the standards of child welfare or protection required in this jurisdiction
- Ø Culture-specific practices, including:
- o Female genital mutilation
- o Forced marriage

## Environmental factors:

- Ø Housing issues
- Ø Children  who  are  out  of  home  and  not living with their parents, whether temporarily or permanently
- Ø Poverty/Begging

## Poor motivation or willingness of parents/guardians to engage:

- Ø Non-attendance at appointments
- Ø Lack of insight or understanding of how the child is being affected
- Ø Lack of understanding about what needs to happen to bring about change

University members should consider these factors as part of being alert to the possibility that a child may be at risk of suffering abuse and in bringing reasonable concerns to the attention of Tusla.

- Ø Avoidance of contact  and  reluctance  to work with services
- Ø Inability or unwillingness to comply with agreed plans
- Ø Conflictual relationships
- Ø Domestic violence
- Ø Adolescent parents
- Ø Domestic violence
- Ø Adolescent parents
- Ø Communication difficulties
- Ø Trafficked/Exploited
- Ø Previous abuse
- Ø Young carer
- o Honour-based violence
- o Radicalisation
- Ø Bullying
- Ø Internet and social media-related concerns

## Bullying

It is recognised that bullying affects the lives of an increasing number of children and can be the cause of genuine concerns about a child's welfare.

Bullying  can  be  defined  as  repeated  aggression  -  whether  it  is  verbal,  psychological  or  physical  -  that  is conducted  by  an  individual  or  group  against  others.  It  is  behaviour  that  is  intentionally  aggravating  and intimidating, and occurs mainly among children in social environments such as schools. It includes behaviours such as physical aggression, cyberbullying, damage to property, intimidation, isolation/exclusion, name-calling, malicious gossip and extortion. Bullying can also take the form of abuse based on gender identity, sexual preference, race, ethnicity and religious factors. With developments in modern technology, children can also be the victims of non-contact bullying, via mobile phones, the internet and other personal devices.

While bullying can happen to any child, some may be more vulnerable. These include: children with disabilities or special educational needs; those from ethnic minority and migrant groups; from the Traveller community; lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) children and those perceived to be LGBT; and children of minority religious faiths.

There can be an increased vulnerability to bullying among children with special educational needs. This is particularly so among those who do not understand social cues and/or have difficulty communicating. Some children with complex needs may lack understanding of social situations and therefore trust everyone implicitly. Such children may be more vulnerable because they do not have the same social skills or capacity as others to recognise and defend themselves against bullying behaviour. Bullying in schools is a particular problem due to the fact that children spend a significant portion of their time there and are in large social groups. In the first instance, the school authorities are responsible for dealing with such bullying. School management boards must have a code of behaviour and an anti-bullying policy in place. The Child Protection Officer/MP should also be aware of the University's anti-bullying policy and of the relevant guidelines on how it is handled. In cases of serious  instances  of  bullying  where  the  behaviour  is  regarded  as  possibly  abusive,  the  Child  Protection Officer/MP may need to make a referral to Tusla and/or An Garda Síochána.

## APPENDIX 3A - EXEMPTIONS FROM REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SEXUAL OFFENCES UNDERAGE CONSENSUAL SEXUAL ACTIVITY

Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 the legal age of consent is 17 years. While a sexual relationship where one or both parties is under 17 years of age is illegal, when making a mandated report to Tusla, it might not be regarded as child sexual abuse.

There are certain exemptions from reporting underage consensual sexual activity under section 14(3) of the 2015 Act. If the Child Protection Officer and MP are satisfied that all of the following criteria are met, s/he will not be required to make a report to Tusla:

- o The young person(s) concerned are between 15 and 17 years old
- o The age difference between them is not more than 24 months
- o There is no material difference in their maturity or capacity to consent
- o The  relationship  between  the  people  engaged  in  the  sexual  activity  does  not  involve  intimidation  or exploitation of either person
- o The young persons concerned state clearly that they do not want any information about the activity to be disclosed to Tusla

In effect, this means that if all of the above criteria are met, the Child Protection Officer/MP do not have to report consensual sexual activity between older teenagers as sexual abuse to Tusla.

## APPENDIX 4 - SCHEDULE OF RELEVANT SERVICES UNDER THE 2015 ACT

## APPENDIX 7 - MANDATED ASSISTANCE

This is an extract from Chapter 3 of the 2017 Guidance.

The 2015 Act imposes a legal obligation on MPs to report mandated concerns to Tusla. MPs can be mandated to assist Tusla in their assessment of child protection and welfare concerns about children who have been the subject of a mandated report.

Tusla's work is greatly enhanced by cooperation and information sharing between professionals in order to determine the best outcomes for children and their families. In the vast majority of cases, this cooperation is forthcoming and mandated assistance will not need to be sought. However, in essential circumstances, where it is determined to be in the best interests of the child, it may be necessary for a formal request for mandated assistance to be made.

The 2015 Act allows Tusla to formally request mandated assistance. Mandated assistance is the provision of:

- Ø Verbal or written information or reports;
- Ø Attendance at any meeting arranged by Tusla in connection with an assessment of a child, e.g. Strategy Meeting, Child Protection Conference; and
- Ø The production to Tusla of any document or thing.

It may be that a verbal telephone report is sufficient or that the MP is asked for copies of existing reports, records or correspondence. The Social Worker may also request that an MP contributes their own professional report to the overall social work assessment.

In order to make a request for mandated assistance, Tusla will submit a mandated assistance form. Tusla will have satisfied the following conditions:

1. The legal threshold for a mandated report should have been reached, i.e. the child has suffered, is likely to or is suffering harm.
2. The request is necessary and proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.
3. An MP is reasonably believed to be in a position to assist having an identified and specific contribution to make to the assessment, as it may be reasonably required.
4. That not making the request for assistance may be detrimental to the best interests of the child.
5. The  MP  is  not  already  voluntarily,  as  part  of  their  normal  duties,  participating  and  assisting  with  the assessment.

Where an MP refuses to assist or fails to engage with an assistance request, the MP will be provided with an opportunity to clarify their reasoning before any decision is taken to challenge the MP's refusal/failure to assist. Following this, if the matter is to be progressed, the following steps are to be taken:

If mandated assistance is not forthcoming, this may lead to Tusla making a report against the MP as a possible fitness to practice matter.

In accordance with section 16(3) the 2015 Act, if an MP furnishes any information (including a report), document or  thing  to  the  Agency  pursuant  to  a  request  for  mandated  assistance,  the  furnishing  of  that  information, document or  thing  shall  not  give  rise  to  any  civil  liability  in  contract,  tort  or  otherwise  and  nor  shall  the information,  document  or  thing  be  admissible  as  evidence  against  that  person  in  any  civil  or  criminal proceedings.
