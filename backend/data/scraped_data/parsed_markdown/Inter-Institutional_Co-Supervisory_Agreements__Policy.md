## Policy on Inter-Institutional CoSupervisory Agreements (including Cotutelle) for PhD Students

Policy owner;

UCD Graduate Studies

Approval date and body

Academic Council 25 th  April 2019

## Introduction

A key strategic objective of UCD is to build the University's engagement locally, nationally and internationally.    The  establishment  of  joint  PhD  degrees  in  collaboration  with  excellent international universities is a valuable instrument in furthering the university's internationalisation strategy. In parallel, PhD candidates benefit from a tailor-made programme of  study  that  incorporates  research  under  two  supervisors  in  two  or  more  research environments  thereby  enhancing  their  research  and  employment  opportunities  on  an international scale.

## 1. Purpose

- 1.1 An Inter-Institutional  Co-Supervisory  Agreement is  drawn up  between collaborating institutions on behalf of one named graduate research student prior to their registering to UCD or partner institution.
- 1.2 This policy seeks to provide clarity of purpose and transparency in practice.
- 1.3 This  policy  will  guide  students,  faculty  and  staff  in  the  establishment  of  an  InterInstitutional Co-Supervisory Agreement. The co-supervisory agreement describes the rules and procedures to which a student will have their registration, supervision and award of a degree with UCD and another higher education institution (HEI). In some instances,  the  partnership  may  extend  to  include  another  party  such  as  industry partner, government agency or non-government organisation.

## 2. Definitions

- 2.1 UCD will enter into an inter-institutional agreement if there is legitimate strategic benefit to the University e.g. to underpin an existing collaboration, facilitate a future collaboration or there is external funding associated with putting the agreement in place.
- 2.2 An inter-institutional agreement provides a student with a joint research supervision agreement that facilitates their pursuing their graduate research programme at two HEIs under two different supervisors and, upon satisfying the degree requirements of both institutions, the student will receive a receive a single joint degree unless there is a legal impediment to this.

## 3 Scope

- 3.1 This policy and the associated documents relate to inter-institutional co-supervision arrangements for a single graduate research student. This can be a stand-alone cotutelle agreement or an arrangement under a specific overarching collaborative agreement such as Universitas 21 joint degree framework or the Marie Skłodowska Curie European Joint Doctorate Programme.
- 3.2 This policy applies to:
- a) Individual UCD graduate research students looking to undertake research in another HEI as part of their graduate research programme
- b) Individual graduate research students from international HEIs wishing to conduct part of their research in UCD.
- 3.3 This policy does not apply to:
- c) a cohort of students on a collaborative graduate research programme. Collaborative programmes are managed under the University's Programme Development, Approval and Review Framework.
- d) Students taking on a research visit to UCD for less than 6 months. UCD allows for PhD students who are registered to another HEI to undertake a period of research and training of up to six months at UCD without incurring a fee. In such cases the student must remain registered at their home Institution where their degree will be awarded, and the student would not be entitled to a degree from UCD

## 4 Principles

The following principles underpin the development of Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreements:

- 4.1 An Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreement may only be drafted for one student.
- 4.2 For each Co-Supervisory Agreement a lead institution must be identified (and named as such, in the Agreement). The principal supervisor will be from the lead institution. The lead institution will normally manage the administration of the progression, examination and conferring of the student.
- 4.3 Students must satisfy the requirements of UCD and the partner institutions with regard to registration, progression, progress reviews, thesis submission and examination and this is articulated in the Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreement.
- 4.4 Students are bound by the UCD Academic Regulations, UCD Student Code and University Academic Policies. In addition, while the student is carrying out research in the partner institution, the partner's regulations will apply.
- 4.5 An inter-institutional, co-supervision agreement between UCD and a partner institution shall support the University's strategic commitment to Equality Diversity and Inclusion.
- 4.6 A viva voce examination is compulsory for PhD students. There will be only one examination which can be held in UCD or in the partner institution. The examination process must align with UCD academic regulations as they pertain to research degree examination and uphold the UCD policy on EDI. A specific examination report must be written for each institutional examination board on their specific templates.

## 5.  Procedure

- 5.1 Please go to Appendix 2 for step by step procedure to set up an inter-institutional cosupervisory agreement

## 6.  Roles and responsibilities

- 6.1 An inter-institutional arrangement will normally be initiated by a member of faculty from UCD or other higher education institution. Parties interested in establishing such an arrangement  must  complete  the  Inter-Institutional  Co-Supervision  Proposal  Form  and submit this to the Graduate Research Board for approval in principle, prior to initiating the drafting of the agreement. Upon approval of the proposal, the parties should work with their Head of School to ensure the feasibility of any proposed arrangement.
- 6.2 Role of Principal Supervisor : The proposed Principal Supervisor is responsible for inter-institutional relationship management and is a signatory to the agreement. If UCD is the  lead  institution,  then  the  UCD  Supervisor  is  the  Principal  Supervisor  and  has

responsibility to submit an Inter-Institutional Co-Supervision Proposal Form to the Graduate Research Board.

- 6.3 Role of PhD Candidate : The PhD Candidate should have an integral role in the crafting of the agreement and must be signatory to the agreement.
- 6.4 Role of Head of School: The co-supervisory arrangements need to be established at School level. The Head of School must be aware of the proposed arrangements and support the submission to the relevant governing board. Therefore, the Head of School is a required signatory to the agreement
- 6.5 Role of Graduate Research Board: The Graduate Research Board reviews all cosupervision proposals and makes the decision to approve or reject that an Inter-institutional Co-Supervisory Agreement is to be negotiated
- 6.6 Role of Dean of Graduate Studies : The Dean of Graduate Studies is responsible for the oversight of all co-supervisory agreements and must approve implementation of any co-supervisory agreement. The Dean is signatory to the agreement as the representative of the UCD.
- 6.7 Role of UCD Graduate Studies: Staff in the Graduate Studies Office have an advisory role to parties interested in setting up a co-supervisory agreement and will manage arrangements to get the signature from the Dean of Graduate Studies.
- 6.8 Role  of  UCD  Registry: Where  UCD  is  the  lead  institution, UCD  Registry  is responsible for the production of the student's joint transcript and/or diploma supplement.
- 6.9 Role  of  UCD  University  Programmes  Board  (UPB): The  UPB  need  to  be informed of any new joint degree arrangements by noting at its regular meetings.
- 6.10 Role of National University of Ireland (NUI): The degrees awarded by UCD are degrees of the National University of Ireland (NUI). As such, NUI is responsible for generating parchments for use in degree conferring ceremonies, including those for joint degrees. The NUI needs to be informed of any new joint degrees approved in UCD.
- 6.11 Role of UCD Conferring Unit: The  UCD Conferring Unit is responsible for the conferring ceremony in UCD. The unit will also liaise with NUI regarding production of the parchment

## Procedure for the Establishment of an Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreement

## A. Introduction

- A.1 This Procedure document should be read in conjunction with the UCD Policy on InterInstitutional Co-Supervisory Agreements for PhD students.
- A.2 An Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreement is drawn up between the collaborating institutions on behalf one named PhD student. A PhD student under such an Agreement can pursue their  graduate research  programme  at two  higher  education  institutions  under  two collaborating supervisors and, upon satisfying the degree requirements of both institutions, the  student  can  receive  a  single  joint  degree.  The  student  will  be  registered  as  a  fulltime student. In some instances, the partnership may extend to include another party such as an industry partner, government agency or non-government organisation.

## B. Procedure

- B.1 The prospective UCD Principal Supervisor, supervisor from the partner institution and PhD student should proceed through the following steps to ensure that all aspects  of cosupervision are considered, and the agreement aligns with the academic regulations of both institutions.  The  prospective  PhD  student  must  meet  the  academic  and  English  language proficiency admission requirements of both UCD and the partner institution.
- B.2 Step 1:  Prior to the registration of the PhD student to either  higher education institution, the UCD faculty member submits an 'Inter-Institutional Co-Supervision Proposal Form'  to  the  Graduate  Research  Board,  seeking  approval  in  principle,  to  establish  a  cosupervisory arrangement for that particular prospective PhD student. UCD will only enter into an inter-institutional agreement if there is legitimate strategic benefit to the University e.g. to underpin  an  existing  collaboration,  facilitate  a  future  collaboration  or  external  funding  is associated with putting the agreement in place. Only when the proposal is approved should the supervisor proceed to draft the co-supervisory agreement.
- B.3 Step 2: The proposed UCD supervisor drafts the Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreement in collaboration  with  the  proposed  supervisor  in  the  partner  institution  and  the prospective student. The UCD template can be used or the partner institution's agreement can be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  UCD  checklist  to  ensure  compliance  with  UCD  academic

regulations  and  other  requirements.  The  UCD  Supervisor  can  seek  guidance  from  UCD Graduate Studies, UCD Global, the College representative on the Graduate Research Board, or the Head of School as appropriate. This process can take 2-3 months to finalise as all aspects of the arrangement need full agreement by each partner institution.

B.4 The  following  items  must  be  addressed  with  respect  to  the  management  of  the graduate research student on the PhD programme.

- a. Degree  Type: UCD  supports  joint  degree  arrangements  and  will  only  consider  a dual/double degree where there is a legal impediment to a joint degree arrangement.
- b.  Admission: The PhD candidate must meet the minimum entry requirements of both UCD as set out in the academic regulations and those of the partner institution. When considering the suitability of a candidate for admission, UCD will ensure that EDI is upheld in the admissions process. The candidate is to be identified as registering for a joint degree award on the UCD Research Student Management System.
- c. Registration and fees: The PhD candidate should be registered both in UCD and the partner institution for the duration of the programme. Normally the fee is paid to the institution where the student is carrying out the research. Students are expected to spend  a  minimum  of  six  consecutive  months  fulltime  in  either  UCD  or  the  partner institution. UCD will not sign a co-supervisory agreement if a student spends less than six months full-time in UCD.
- d.  Supervision: There must be a minimum of one named supervisor in each institution. The  supervisor  in  the  lead  institution  will  be  the  Principal  Supervisor  with  primary responsibility  for  the  academic  supervision  of  the  research  degree  student.  The supervisor in the partner institution will act as Co-supervisor.
- e. 30 Credit Requirement PhD candidates must complete a minimum of 30 credits of education and training modules which can be taken at either institution and the credits can be transferred between institutions.
- f. A Research Studies Panel must be put in place for every student, normally at the time of their registration to UCD. Faculty from each institution should be represented on the Research Studies Panel. The Panel comprises of the supervisors and at least two but no more than four advisors.
- g.  Progression: A  minimum  of  one  formal  progression  step  must  be  included  in  the student's  doctoral  programme.  In  UCD,  this  is  the  Stage1-  Stage  2  Transfer Assessment which is held within five trimesters of registration for a fulltime student.
- h. Data  Protection: Student  data  will  need  to  be  transferred  between  collaborating institutions.  The  student  must  specifically  consent  to  the  sharing  of  their  personal details including assessment results unless there is an alternative lawful basis to justify

the processing of the student's personal data. The collaborating institutions will enter into a data sharing agreement in respect of any personal data of a student to be shared between them.

- i. Insurance: UCD and partner institution will maintain policies of insurance covering any negligent  acts,  errors  or  omissions  in  connection  with  their  performance  of  the agreement and the hosting of a student there-under.

UCD does NOT provide health insurance, EU students studying in Ireland or vice versa should obtain a European Health Insurance Card which will provide them with access to  the  public  health  system  of  the  EU  country  within  which  they  are  not  normally resident. In addition to the EHIC, such students should also consider taking out travel and  personal  accident  insurance  in  their  home  country  in  respect  of  their  time  in another country. Non-EU students must obtain private health insurance either in their home country or in Ireland. Insurance must cover the student for up to €25,000 for inhospital treatment.

- j. Discipline: All UCD students are under the UCD Student Code while registered to a UCD programme. When the student is in the partner institution, their Code of Conduct may also apply.
- k. Intellectual Property: The intellectual property rights of material developed by each institution shall remain the property of that institution.
- l. Health and Safety: Each party is responsible for ensuring that the student is provided with a safe place of study / research during their time with said party. All necessary safety information, training, equipment, induction and oversight will be provided by the party hosting the student at that time.
- m.  Appeals: A  candidate  may  appeal  an  assessment  decision  conducted  by  UCD through the assessment appeals process set out in the UCD Assessments Appeals Policy. If the appeal is to a decision of the partner institution, then their appeals process applies.
- n.  Final  Examination :  One  partner  institution  (normally  the  lead  institution)  will  be responsible  for  organising  the  viva  voce  examination.  The  recommendation  of  the Examination Committee must be written up as a report. UCD requires the report to be completed  on  the  UCD  template  for  consideration  by  the  UCD  Academic  Council Committee  of  Examinations  (ACCE).  The  partner  institution  may  have  their  own specific report template for completion or alternatively they can accept the UCD report.

The UCD ACCE and its equivalent in the partner institution will decide, on the basis of the submitted report and, where necessary, clarification or correspondence with the examiners whether to accept the recommendation of the Examination Committee and

award or not award the degree. The recommendation of the Examination Committee to award the PhD must be accepted by both institutions for the PhD to be awarded.

- o. Subject to its legal liability, each institution shall indemnify and keep indemnified its own  staff,  students  and  agents  against  claims  arising  under  any  interinstitutional agreement and the hosting of a student there-under.  Neither institution shall be liable for any act, omission, neglect, default, loss, damage, personal injury or theft arising from the actions of the staff, students and agents of the other institution.

B.5 Step 3: The UCD supervisor drafts the agreement and submits it to the Head of the  School where  the  research  student  will  be  registered.  If  the  Head  of  School  is  in agreement with the proposed arrangement they will make a recommendation to Graduate Research Board. If the Head of School is not satisfied with the  feasibility of the proposed arrangement  then  the  agreement  cannot  proceed,  and  the  agreement  will  need  to  be redrafted.

B.6 Step 4: The draft agreement is submitted to the Graduate Research Board for their  consideration  and  for  verification  that  the  agreement  aligns  with  the  University's Education  Strategy,  upholds  the  UCD  policies  and  procedures  and  the  articles  within  the agreement  align  with  college  practices.  If  the  Graduate  Research  Board  approves,  the agreement will be signed by Dean of Graduate Studies

B.8 Step 5: The agreement signed by all required signatories, if not already gathered, and sent to the partner institution for counter signatures.

B.9 Step 6: The agreement will be entered into Rowan, the UCD Global Partnership Database.

B.11 Step 7The National University of Ireland (NUI) will be notified of this new co supervisory agreement and provided with the contact details of the person in the partner institution with responsibility for official document management.

B.12 Step 8 Student is enrolled in both institutions and carries out their PhD programme as outlined in the Inter-institutional Co-Supervisory Agreement.

B.13 Step 9; Where UCD is the lead institution, the student will be issued with a Joint Diploma Supplement which will normally carry the crest of both Universities. UCD will  require  the  contact  details  of  the  Administrator  in  the  partner  institution  which  has responsibility for official document production to share logos etc.

B.14 Step 10 Where UCD is the lead institution, the National University of Ireland (NUI) - of which UCD is a constituent university - will generate the degree parchment. NUI

will  require  the  contact  details  of  the  Administrator  in  the  partner  institution  which  has responsibility for official document production to share logos etc.

B.15 Step 11 Where UCD is the lead institution, the student will normally be conferred at UCD.
