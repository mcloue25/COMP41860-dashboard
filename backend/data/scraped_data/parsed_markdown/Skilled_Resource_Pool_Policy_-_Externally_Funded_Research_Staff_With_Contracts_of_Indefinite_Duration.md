## UCD Skilled Resource Pool Policy

## Externally Funded Research Staff With Contracts of Indefinite Duration

## Policy Summary

This university policy deals with research staff in UCD that have been issued with contracts of indefinite duration (CID) and who must continue to be paid from and occupied on externally funded research work - unless they secure, through the normal recruitment processes, an alternative core-funded role.

These staff are a valuable group within the university who have already made significant contribution to the development of research through their work on specific projects.  This policy and procedure sets out how the university will enable this group to continue to contribute.

The university's commitment to 'CID' research staff is to:

-  Maximise  their  opportunities  for  continued  assignment  to  externally funded research projects through the  use of a Skilled Resource Pool (SRP).
-  Provide supports to assist them in developing their careers and skills set  so  they  may  have  flexibility  to  transition  to  other  roles  within  the university through the normal recruitment process.

This policy is divided into two parts:

Part A covers the principles that govern the operation of the SRP.

Part B outlines a generic SRP process to be used as a model for implementation in a College, subject to any local tailoring that may be appropriate

## A.  Key  Principles  Governing  the  Operation  of  the Skilled Resource Pool (SRP)

The Skilled Resource Pool (SRP) is the mechanism through which Research staff who have received contracts of indefinite duration (CIDs) continue to be assigned  to  work  on  externally  funded  research  projects.    A  minimum  of  3 months  from  the  end  of  their  current  project  assignment,  the  staff  member makes their details available to PIs with vacancies for research-funded roles. PIs are required to give full consideration to SRP candidates in the filling  of vacancies prior to any external advertising being approved.

## UCD Skilled Resource Pool Policy

## Externally Funded Research Staff With Contracts of Indefinite Duration

The following principles apply:

1.  The Principal Investigator (PI) managing the researcher at the time the CID  was  issued  will  retain  responsibility  for  the  management  of  the researcher through the SRP process and onto other suitable research work. This responsibility will continue indefinitely unless/until the researcher secures an alternative core-funded role through the normal competitive process, and could involve several re-assignment processes over a number of years.
2.  Whilst a researcher is in the SRP they will remain the responsibility of the  PI  who  was  managing  them  at  the  time  their  CID  was  issued,  in terms of ensuring that they have an appropriate place to work and have agreed  activities  which  they  can  undertake.  These  should  be  agreed with  the  Head  of  School  and  may  include  activities  to  support  the School's research objectives, the researchers own portfolio of research or to help with their re-assignment e.g. completion of papers, supporting grant applications.
3.  A College level SRP mechanism will be established in each College to support  and  facilitate  Schools  with  the  review  and  management  of funded assignments for these research staff in a proactive manner.
4.  Researchers in the SRP must be given first consideration in relation to relevant vacancies arising in their College. This means that any PI with a research vacancy must first review the profiles of any research staff in the College Level SRP for consideration in relation to their vacancy if any.
5.  Any PI with a vacancy may only advertise post doctoral post(s) outside the College level SRP if
- a.  They have initially reviewed potential candidates within the SRP and this process has not provided a suitable candidate.
- b.  The Head of School and College Principal/Vice President/ Head of  School agree that there are no potential matches within the SRP.
6.  Whilst  a  PI  has  a  researcher  in  the  SRP  pending  re-assignment, university policy will not permit that PI to carry out recruitment for other post doctoral posts.
7.  Any shortfall between the existing salary of the researcher in the SRP and  that  available  for  a  new  post  will  be  funded  by  the  originating School budget, that is the School the researcher was attached to at the time of issue of the CID. It is not possible to reduce the salary of the

researcher and salary variations should not be a barrier to an otherwise suitable assignment.

8.  Where  a  researcher  is  unassigned,  a  designated  unfunded  project code will be established in the name of the PI responsible and ongoing and cumulative salary costs of  the  researcher  will  be  charged  to  this account for up to 6 months.
9.  Career  Advice  will  be  provided  through  the  PI  and  from  Career Advisory  Services  to  enable  the  researcher  to  plan  for  and  manage their career and ultimately exit the SRP cycle.

## B.  The  College  Level  Skilled  Resource  Pool  (SRP) Process

It is proposed that each College can tailor the details of this process to their own requirements, using the following guidelines to ensure clarity of purpose and overall consistency.  Recognising that suitable opportunities may exist outside the immediate School in which the researcher resides, the process should operate at the College level so that the best possible matching of candidates to potential projects will be enabled.

## Process Part 1 - Managing Staff into the SRP

- a. Once  a  month,  a  Resource  Planning  meeting  should  be  held with  dual  objectives  of  ensuring  that  the  necessary  forward planning is applied to the management of fixed-term contracts and that any researchers are rapidly matched to available new posts. This meeting should be chaired by the College Principal/Vice-President  and  attended  by  relevant  Heads  of Schools,  the  HR  Partner,  Finance  Manager  and  any  other relevant staff. The meeting should focus on:
- i.  The list of all  staff  on  fixed-term  contracts due to end in the  following  3  months  (this  being  the  minimum  window for such planning).
- ii.  The status of all researchers in the SRP.
- iii.   A list of all new research funded posts planned over the coming  three  months,  with  a  view  to  enabling  potential matches to be made from within the SRP.
- iv.  Considering applications from PI's who  are seeking permission to advertise roles under Part A -Key

Principles 5 a. and b. ( A template application form will be provided)

- b.  Not later  than  3  months  prior  to  the  end  of  the  current assignment of a CID researcher, and where the PI themselves cannot  identify  an  immediate  alternative,  the  PI  will  notify  the Head of School and the relevant College administrator that this researcher is becoming available for re-assignment and should be added to the Skilled Resource Pool.
- c.   In parallel, not later than 3 months prior to the end of the current assignment,  the  PI  will  inform  the  staff  member  that  their assignment  is  coming  to  an  end  and  request  them  to  upload their  up-to-date  CV  to  the  e-Recruit  system  where  it  will  be viewable  by  other  PIs  in  the  College  who  are  planning  to  fill vacancies. A special section has been set up in the e-Recruit system to facilitate this.
- d. No  later  than  6  weeks  prior  to  the  end  date  of  the  current assignment and where no re-assignment has yet been identified, the PI will complete a the SRP From, Part A to advise UCD  Finance  and  HR  of  the  end  of  the  assignment  and indicating  the 'unfunded' project code the researcher is to be paid from while awaiting assignment.

## Process Part 2 - Managing Staff Out of the SRP

- a.  Where  an  immediate  alternative  assignment  is  identified  by  the existing PI, either a continuation on the current project or a move to a new project, they will fill in the relevant part of the SRP Form to notify Finance and HR so that systems and records can be updated and a new assignment letter can be issued to the staff member.
- b.  A PI with  a  research  vacancy  must first  review  the  profiles  of  the research staff in the College Level SRP for consideration in relation to  their  vacancy  and  will  not  be  permitted  to  advertise  externally unless this process is completed and approval sought in line with 5 a and b above.
- c.  If they consider there are some potential matches they must contact the  researcher  to  further  assess  their  suitability  for  this  role  and ideally  an  appointment  will  follow  for  the  duration  of  the  funding available.

- d.  When a PI identifies a suitable candidate within the SRP they fill in the SRP Form Part C to notify Finance and HR so that systems and records can be updated and a new assignment letter can be issued to the staff member
- e. If,  after  a  continuous  period  of  6  months  in  the  SRP,  no  suitable externally  funded  assignment  has  been  identified  for  the  staff member, their costs will be transferred to a cost centre within the School and future work allocation will be determined by the Head of School. The SRP Form Part A will be completed by the PI to effect this change. Restrictions on the filling of further posts will remain in force for that PI for as long as the research staff member remains unfunded.

## 1.1.1 Roles and responsibilities within the Process:

- i. The College Principal/Vice President and potentially VP Research &amp; Innovation or other College Research Management nominee, are responsible for putting in place and ensuring the effective operation of the College Level SRP process, and for overseeing the College level Register of researchers in the SRP with significant support provided by the HR Partner.
- ii. The PI is responsible for carrying out appropriate staff planning reviews on a monthly basis, which will include proactive management of FTC roles and managing the assignments of CID researchers into/out of the SRP. PIs that do not have CID researchers are responsible for ensuring that they give full and fair consideration to researchers in the SRP before they seek any approval to advertise outside the SRP.
- iii. Each CID researcher is responsible for proactively seeking alternative roles for themselves and seeking to develop their skills and qualifications with a view to competing for other roles outside the SRP process.
- iv. The Head of School is responsible for ensuring that the processes established are effectively operated so that there is minimum impact on the school budget and available resources are effectively assigned.
- v. The HR Partner is responsible for supporting all of the above in carrying out their functions and will work to ensure that the relevant people have easy access to appropriate staff
