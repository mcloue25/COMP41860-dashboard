To promote the protection of the public and encourage public trust and confidence, UCD is committed to ensuring that these students are vetted and only suitable candidates are allowed to continue in their programme of study.

The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/47/enacted/en/html commenced on 29th April 2016 and made it a legal requirement for any work or activities, carried out by a person, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to or contact with children or vulnerable persons to be vetted by the National Vetting Bureau in An Garda Síochána.

## 3.1 Responsibility

## 3.1.1 Admissions Office

The UCD Admissions Office is responsible for managing and operating the University student vetting process through the National Vetting Bureau's eVetting system.

## 3.1.2 Student

Each student must disclose to UCD all information required for the process of vetting including the completion of the vetting application and any Police Certificates required as outlined in section 3.2.

## 3.1.3 Programme / School Unit

It is the responsibility of the relevant programme / school unit to ensure that no student carries out any work or activities, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the student having access to or contact with children or vulnerable persons until their vetting process is successfully completed.

Details of relevant work or activities are outlined in part 1 and 2 of Schedule 1 of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2012/act/47/enacted/en/html

In exceptional circumstances, other evidence may be accepted by the University in lieu of a Police certificate (e.g., Student Affidavits).

## 3.3 Vetting Disclosure

UCD uses the vetting disclosure returned from the National Vetting Bureau to assess the suitability of students. The disclosure can include particulars of the criminal record (if any) relating to the student or a statement that there is no criminal record in relation to the student or any prosecutions pending against them.

## ADMISSIONS UCD REGISTRY

## 3.4 Specified Information

The vetting disclosure may also contain specified information in relation to a person who is the subject of an application for a vetting disclosure, meaning information concerning a finding or allegation of harm to another person received by the National Vetting Bureau from An Garda Síochána or a Scheduled Organisation pursuant to section 19 of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016.

It is information that is considered to reasonably give rise to a bona fide concern that the vetting subject may

- i. harm any child or vulnerable person,
- ii. cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed,
- iii. put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm,
- iv. attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, or,
- v. incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person.

## 3.5 Vetted Students with Charge(s)/Prosecution(s) and/or Conviction(s) and/or Specified Information

In the event where students do not meet the vetting requirements of the University, registration on such programmes may be subject to final cancellation or temporary cancellation (where continuance of registration is conditional on meeting specified criteria). If information relating to a charge/prosecution and/or conviction is not given or is given in an incomplete form, the University reserves the right at any stage (including after an offer of a place has been made, or after registration) to reject the application or, where applicable, withdraw the offer or cancel the registration.

Having a charge/prosecution and/or conviction and/or specified information will not necessarily prevent an applicant from gaining admission to the relevant programme. However, the University will take any relevant prosecutions or convictions or specified information of a prospective applicant or registered student into account when considering her/his application and reserves the right to refuse admission or cancel registration of a person admitted where her/his previous charge(s)/ prosecution(s)/ conviction(s) or specified information make it inappropriate for her/him to be a student of the relevant programme.

In reaching a decision regarding the admission or continuance of a student, the University will balance the interests of the student (and its ability to provide any appropriate support arrangements) with seeking to provide a safe and secure environment for the public and its staff, students, visitors and others. In addition, the University will take account of the demands and requirements of relevant professional bodies and requirements under the law to protect special categories of people, for example children and vulnerable adults.

## ADMISSIONS UCD REGISTRY

- Any other information recorded relating to the commission of or involvement in the commission of a charge/prosecution and/or conviction and/or specified information, which would give rise or would be likely to give rise to a bona-fide concern that the individual poses a risk to the safety of children, vulnerable adults or the wider community.

It is important to note that whilst the factors above shall be considered, the list is not exhaustive, and the assessment shall be made taking account of all relevant factors and circumstances pertaining to a student and her/his programme.

If the student has been cleared at this point, the UCD Vetting Team will provide written assurance to the School that the student has been subject to vetting and has been deemed appropriate to have her/his registration continued and undertake placement where applicable. The vetting hold will be removed from the students record.

If the Committee is of the view clearance has not been obtained, the case shall be escalated, and the disclosure shall require further review in accordance with section 4.5.5 (Further review of serious charge(s)/prosecution(s) /conviction(s) and/or specified information.

## 4.5.5 Further review of serious charge(s)/prosecution(s) conviction(s) and/or specified information

If a further review is required, the assessment criteria outlined in section 4.5.4, plus any other relevant factors or circumstances will be considered by at least 3 members of the UCD Vetting Review Committee (including Head of School or nominee) and a further meeting with the student may be requested. It will be evaluated whether there are sufficient grounds on which the student can continue in their programme. If sufficient grounds do not exist, it will be decided that the student can no longer remain a registered student of UCD. This cancellation of registration will be final or will be imposed for a period of time (where continuance of registration at a future time is conditional on specified criteria).

Following the review, the student will be advised of the decision in writing.

## 5. Appeals Mechanism

An appeal may be made to the University's Student Appeals Committee within 10 working days from the date of issue of the decision of the UCD Vetting Review Committee. Details of the appeal procedure can be found in the Student Appeals Procedure.

Appeals may be made on the following grounds.

- New evidence: Information directly relevant to the decision, which for good reason was not available to the UCD Vetting Review Committee.
- Procedural irregularity: There is evidence that the procedures relating to a decision were not followed properly, which may have impacted on the Student Vetting Committee's decision.

The Student Appeals Committee may:

- Uphold the Appeal
- Reject the Appeal

## 6. Review of a Vetting Decision

If at some point further information comes to the attention of the University that calls a vetting decision into question, a stay will be put on the student's placement and the student shall be suspended from carrying out the work placement until such information has been considered by the Vetting Review Committee. In reaching a decision regarding the continuance of a student, the University will balance the interests of the student (and its ability to provide any appropriate support arrangements) with seeking to provide a safe and secure environment for the public and its staff, students, visitors and others. In addition, the University will take account of the demands and requirements of relevant professional bodies and requirements under the law to protect special categories of people, for example children and vulnerable adults.

## 7. Re-Vetting

Students should be aware that, given the duration of certain Programmes, the University reserves the right, at its discretion, to require certain groups of students or individual students to undergo a further Student Vetting process during the course of their Programme. In addition, a student member may be re-vetted if information concerning suitability to work with children or vulnerable adults comes to the attention of the University.

Should the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts change, making it a mandatory requirement to conduct re-vetting after a certain length of time, UCD will act in accordance with the changes issued in the Acts.
