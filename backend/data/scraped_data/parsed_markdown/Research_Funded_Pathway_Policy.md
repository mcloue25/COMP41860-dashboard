## 1. Purpose of Policy

The University developed this pathway to enable the University to attract outstanding academic staff by granting positions to individuals from other institutions  who  have  successfully  competed  for  major  research  grants from prestigious funding agencies.  It is the intention that this pathway will allow  the  University  to  appoint  researchers  into  positions  which  reflect UCD's strategic priorities:

- (a)  Senior  academic  staff  who  are  research  leaders,  and  who  are internationally recognised scholars with substantial research experience from respected, high-calibre institutions.
- (b)  Early career academic staff, who are high-potential researchers.

## 2. Scope of the Policy

This pathway may be considered;

-  To  attract  outstanding  faculty  by  granting  positions  to  individuals from other institutions  who  have  successfully  competed for major research grants from prestigious funding agencies
-  Prior to the application for research funding being submitted to or confirmation  of  the  award  by  the  funding  agency.    In  these circumstances any offer of appointment will be subject to subsequent confirmation of the full research award by the funding agency
-  To  retain  current  research  funded  staff  who  have  successfully competed  for  major  research  grants  from  prestigious  funding agencies
- (a) Senior  faculty  appointed  at  Professorial  grades  (Professor  or  Full Professor) through this pathway will be research leaders with a track record that is internationally acknowledged for its significance. Achievement  will  be  recognised  via established  metrics in their respective fields and might include bodies such as Fellow of the Royal Society  or  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences.    They  will  have  been successful in attracting competitive research funding to their programmes over a sustained period of time and demonstrated their ability as academic leaders in education.
- (b) Early career faculty appointed at either Lecturer/Assistant Professor or Associate Professor grade through this pathway, will be high-potential researchers with an emerging record of achievement that is internationally-recognised,  and  is  beyond  normal  expectations  for achievement at that grade.

In all cases, the applicant's research plan must advance the strategic plan of the University.  They will be internationally-recognised researchers, and

## Research Funded Pathway Policy

will show a commitment to actively engage with/apply for additional future funding on a competitive basis from all appropriate funding programmes. Applicants will be expected to demonstrate a willingness to contribute as faculty to the wider activities of the University.

## 3. Assessment Principles

Consistent with the Faculty Promotion Policy, appointments at UCD will be judged on international standards, will be evidence-based, and will be entirely founded on merit. The mechanism and process for appointing researchers under this policy shall uphold the University's commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.

Appointments  will  be  considered  within  the  overall  strategy  for  the University and the College, and must allow for, and encourage, synergies with  developments  elsewhere  in  the  University.  These  are,  therefore, University appointments as well as College and School appointments.

3.1    The appointment criteria are set out in the Development Framework for Faculty under three headings, though the primary focus of assessment will be under Research, Scholarship &amp; Innovation:

- I. Research, Scholarship &amp; Innovation
- II. Teaching &amp; Learning
- III. Leadership &amp; Contribution

In  addition,  all  successful  applicants  under  this  pathway  will  be  in possession of (or their appointment conditional on receipt of) a substantial research  project  award  from  a  funding  agency,  such  as,  the  European Research  Council  (ERC),  or  equivalent  prestigious  funding  agency,  the University's consideration of such appointments will relate to:

-  The academic track record, leadership, ability  and  trajectory of the applicant;
-  The prestige of the research award and funding agency, and the mechanism by which the award is/was made;
-  The  importance  of  the  applicant  and  the  research  area  to UCD's research strategy and to the appropriate Institute/School and College;
-  The level of commitment and confirmed ability of the relevant Institute/School  and  College  to  provide  continued  financial support should support from the funding agency be withdrawn or not be renewed.
-  The opinions of three independent external assessors

## 4. Assessment Process

When an  application  has  been  received  by  UCD  HR,  Promotions,  Grading and Reward a copy will be forwarded to the President (or in his absence the Deputy President). The President (or Deputy President), following consultation  with  the  relevant  College  Principal/,  Head  of  School  or  other senior faculty as appropriate, will determine if there is a prima facie case to assess the application;

A prima facie case will exist, if following consultation, the President (or Deputy President) decides that the body of evidence against the criteria as set out in the Development Framework for Faculty merits further assessment;

Where the President (or Registrar) agrees that there is a prima facie case to assess an applicant under this process they will:

-  Establish an Evaluation Committee, consisting of five senior members of  the  University  with  relevant  expertise,  chaired  by  the  relevant College  Principal.  In  establishing  this  Committee,  the  President  (or Deputy President) will take into account the need for gender balance and diversity.

## 5. Role of the Evaluation Committee

The Evaluation Committee will appoint three independent external assessors who  shall  be  asked  to  provide  written  assessments  on  the  applicant's suitability for appointment;

The Chair of the Committee will forward the names and contact details of the independent  external  assessors  to  UCD  HR,  Promotions,  Grading  and Reward who will request the reports.

External assessors appointed by the Committee will be required to evaluate and determine whether the applicant:

-  Works  in  an  important  area  of  research  in  the  specific discipline and is investigating important questions in that area;
-  Possesses  an  established  international  reputation  based  on research  achievement,  knowledge  advancement,  discovery and contribution to the discipline;
-  Has achieved an academic leadership position in the discipline  or  demonstrates  significant  potential  to  achieve  a profile of academic leadership in their discipline;

-  Has an established teaching track record informed by research, commensurate with their current position;
-  Would  be  appointed to an equivalent position in other Universities of comparable or better standing.

The Committee will review the reports of the external assessors, assess the application against the criteria as set out in the Development Framework for Faculty  and  may  recommend  appointment at  the  level  of  Lecturer/Assistant Professor,  Associate  Professor,  Professor  or  Full  Professor,  as  appropriate and will forward its recommendation to the President.

Where  the  President  agrees  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to  make  an appointment - they will  make  a  decision,  and  that  decision  will  be  final.    A positive decision for appointment will take the form of either:

-  A  commitment  to  appoint the applicant at an appropriate academic grade, subject to the subsequent confirmation of the full research award by the funding agency, or;
-  Appoint the applicant at the appropriate academic grade, where the research award has already been made.

The President's decision will be forwarded to the Governing Authority and the Academic Council for noting.

## 6. Role of UCD HR

Following the decision of the President, UCD HR, Promotions, Grading and Reward will inform the following in writing of the decision and advise that appointment will be made subject to the normal recruitment process:

-  The applicant
-  The  relevant  College  Principal/Head  of  School  and  /  or  the Director of the  Research  Institute,  HR  Partner  and  College Finance manager

UCD HR, Promotions, Grading and Reward will forward the application and relevant  documentation  to  UCD  HR,  Resourcing  in  order  that  they  may complete the normal recruitment process.
