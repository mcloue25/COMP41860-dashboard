## UCD Fertility Treatment Policy

Policy owner

## 1. Purpose

UCD is committed to providing a supportive workplace for all our employees including for individuals who are undergoing fertility treatment. A supportive environment includes a culture that facilitates employees undergoing fertility treatment, employees whose partners are undergoing fertility treatment, and the provision of supports aligned to good practice. It is important to UCD that employees who are planning to have children, feel fully supported to do so and are facilitated to balance career and their fertility journey.

Couples who do not conceive a child naturally, for same-sex couples, and individuals seeking to have a child, may undergo fertility treatment. UCD recognises the emotional, physical, and financial strain fertility treatment can have on employees while trying to navigate their careers.  Fertility journeys vary in length, number of treatments, side effects and can be very individualised.

This policy reflects the high value the University places on our employees and seeks to provide support and clarity to employees and managers on how to best support employees flexibly and compassionately during this period.

This policy supports the UCD Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy vision for the University to be a leader and role model in equality, diversity and inclusion in the higher education sector nationally and internationally and meets the University's objective to specifically attract, retain and develop an excellent and diverse cohort of faculty, and staff.

## Disclosure

When a person communicates that they are undergoing fertility treatment or their partner is undergoing fertility treatment to another person.

Disclosing information about fertility treatment is voluntary. It is a deeply personal and sensitive matter and it is up to the individual if they wish to divulge specific personal information.

UCD encourages a culture where employees feel confident to share their fertility journey in the workplace if they choose to do so. Fertility is a very personal and sensitive area for individuals and it should be recognised that some employees may be seeking flexibility while choosing not to disclose their fertility journey.

## Flexible Working and Fertility Treatment

Flexibility may also include:

- Allowing time to rest and make the time up later
- Adjusting start and finish times
- Flexibility around the taking of breaks
- Flexibility around attending relevant medical appointments.

## Medical Appointments and Procedures
