- providing training, resources and support to UCD researchers to ensure that they are aware of their obligations in respect of these policies and procedures and are able to comply with them; and
- monitoring  these  measures  for  suitability  and  effectiveness  and  reviewing  them  where necessary.

UCD Researchers should:

- recognise their responsibility to conduct research of high ethical standards;
- be aware UCD's policies and procedures on responsible conduct of research;
- make sure that their research complies with these policies and procedures, and seek guidance from UCD when necessary;
- work with  UCD to ensure  that  they  have  the  necessary  training,  resources  and  support  to comply with their responsible conduct of research obligations; and
- suggest to  UCD how guidance on  responsible conduct of research might be  developed or revised.

## 5.  Responsible Conduct of Research

All UCD researchers should be familiar with and adhere to the UCD policies and procedures that govern the research process, as well as the other institutional policies of the University. These policies are referenced throughout this document and the most recent versions can be accessed from the UCD Governance Document Library.

Further, researchers must adhere to the terms and conditions of the funding agency/sponsor with regard to any award being made for funded research activity. The research grant provides a written agreement to  conduct  research  activity  in  return  for  approved  funding  and  is  made  between  the  funding agency/sponsor and the University. The University is accountable for managing the invested funds associated with research activity through its academic units and academic staff. It does this by devolving responsibility of management of these funds to the academic units and the lead researcher, who is charged with managing the programmatic and financial viability of the proposed research activity.

## 5.1 Research Integrity

UCD is committed to the promotion of an environment which maintains the highest standards of integrity in relation to its educational mission and research activity. It is University policy that UCD researchers maintain the highest standards of rigour and integrity in all aspects of research and ensure that research is conducted according to appropriate ethical, legal and professional obligations and standards. The University's Research Integrity Policy provides detailed guidance on this matter.

It is imperative that when an allegation of research misconduct arises, suitable procedures are in place to deal with it effectively and fairly. UCD has a responsibility to the researchers it employs, and there needs to be appropriate protection for the rights and interests of all parties. The University's Procedure for  the  Investigation  of  Misconduct  in  Research outlines  the  procedure  to  be  used  to  manage allegations of research misconduct within UCD.

## 5.2 Research Ethics

All research that involves either human or animal subjects carried out by UCD researchers requires either full ethical review or an exemption from full ethical review. The University's Research Ethics Policy and associated Committee guidelines provide detailed guidance on this matter. The Policy is

applicable to all UCD researchers and should be read in tandem with the UCD Code of Good Practice in Research with Humans and Animals and the REC Operating Procedures .

## 5.3 Employee Code of Conduct

The Employee Code of Conduct Policy collates the UCD policies and procedures governing employee conduct to ensure that all employees are familiar with and can adhere to UCD policies and procedures that are relevant to required standards of conduct.

## 5.4 Research Data Management

The UCD Research Data Management (RDM) Policy provides a framework for the management of research data to ensure that research data is stored, retained, made available for use and reuse, and disposed of according to best international practices for data management, as well as in compliance with legal, statutory, ethical, contractual and intellectual property obligations, and the requirements of funding bodies and publishers.

## 5.5 Policy for Supervision of Research Degree Students

The University is committed to achieving the highest standards of excellence in the research training, professional  development  and  supervision  of  research  students  and  expects  all  relevant  parties  to adhere to the core principles [ outlined in the Policy ]. The UCD Policy for Supervision of Research Degree  Students , outlines  each  party's  roles  and  responsibilities  governing  the  professional relationships  between  supervisor(s)  and  students.  The  policy  is  applicable  to  all  research  degree programmes and is supplementary to the UCD Academic Regulations.

## 5.6 Funded Research Activity

The UCD Funded Research Activity Policy provides guidance on the roles and responsibilities of both the organisation and individual researchers carrying out funded research projects at UCD. This includes detailed guidance on UCD Researchers' responsibilities in preparing proposals, as well as the eligibility of UCD Researchers to register and manage research accounts on the UCD financial system.

## 5.7 Intellectual Property

UCD  supports  excellence  in  innovation  by  encouraging  UCD  Researchers  to  develop  world-class Intellectual Property (IP) and commercialise it by licensing it to companies, institutions, etc to develop new innovative products and services. The University's Intellectual Property Policy provides detailed guidance on how the creators of UCD IP receive recognition and a share from the revenues received from licensing of UCD IP, and it supports and rewards UCD Researchers for creating and growing new innovative companies based on UCD IP.

## 5.8 Conflict of Interest

UCD Researchers have an obligation to manage or avoid ethical, legal, financial or other conflicts of interest  and  to  ensure  that  their  activities  and  interests  do  not  conflict  with  their  obligations  to  the University or its welfare.  It is the responsibility of UCD Researchers to identify and declare any potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, whether financial, beneficial, personal, ethical, legal, or other, so that this does not become a complicating or actionable issue. The University's Conflict of Interest Policy provides detailed guidance on this matter.

## 5.9 Authorship

Dissemination of the findings of research and scholarship through excellent publications is central to the University's mission. Appropriate recognition of authorship is an important element of a publication, reflecting both credit and responsibility for the work. The University's Authorship Policy outlines the policy on authorship of publications arising from the research and scholarship of UCD Researchers.

## 5.10 Consultancy and External Work

UCD permits members of the academic staff to engage in external consulting in order to expand and maintain their professional competence, keep abreast of developments and innovation in business and the professions, and to support the Irish economy and enhance the reputation of the University by sharing  the  University's  scientific  and  academic  knowledge  with  the  business  community  and  the professions. The University's Consultancy and External Work Policy describes the circumstances under which academic staff may engage external work, either in their own right or on behalf of the University.

## 5.11 Training and Development

UCD is committed to providing its staff with high quality learning initiatives to shape their professional and personal development through the People Development and Organisational Effectiveness unit of UCD HR. This unit designs and runs a suite of programmes aimed at supporting faculty and staff in their  day-to-day  activities,  improving  skills  while  also  expanding  areas  of  expertise.  UCD  also implements  the Performance  for  Growth  Policy ,  which  is  a  framework  containing  elements  of individual and career development and performance management.

For Post-doctoral Fellows, UCD has established the UCD Researcher Careers Framework (RCF), a structured and supportive skills and early career development model. This provides a research career structure  with  clear  role  definition,  structured  employment  framework  with  a  career  path  that  is supported by clear contract management policy and consistent recruitment processes, and a Skills and Career Development (SCD) Framework and supporting policy.

## 5.12 Sustainability

In  UCD, we have a long-standing commitment to sustainability and our UCD Strategy incorporates sustainability as one of its four strategic themes 'Creating a Sustainable Global Society'. Additionally, UCD recognises the key challenges and opportunities outlined in Ireland's Research and Innovation Strategy - Impact 2030 and our responsibilities to support the achievement of the UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDG's). We focus on interdisciplinary research delivered through partnerships with civil society, industry, governments and academic institutions to deliver solutions that are balanced across the SDGs. UCD has committed to examine and adapt our research practices to support our commitment to sustainability, such as through its involvement in the Sustainable Research Initiative.
