## UCD Research Integrity Policy

Policy owner

## 1. Purpose

University College Dublin is committed to the promotion of an environment which maintains the highest standards of integrity in relation to its educational mission and research activity. It is university policy that  all  those  engaged  with  research  in  UCD,  including  all  researchers,  students,  technical, administrative and research support staff:

- maintain the highest standards of rigour and integrity in all aspects of research; and
- ensure  that  research  is  conducted  according  to  appropriate  ethical,  legal  and  professional obligations and standards.

## UCD commits to:

- supporting a research environment that is underpinned by a culture of integrity and based on good governance, best practice and support for the development of researchers;
- using transparent, robust and fair processes to deal with allegations of research misconduct should they arise;
- promoting  research  integrity  and  incorporating  research  integrity  into  learning,  training  and mentoring opportunities which support the development of researchers; and
- working to strengthen the integrity of research and to review progress regularly and openly.

## The purpose of this policy is to:

- set out the principles of research integrity and research misconduct; and
- outline  the  principles  that  underpin  transparent,  fair  and  effective  procedures  to  deal  with allegations of research misconduct when they arise.

It aims to ensure that all research activity in UCD aligns with the National policy statement on Ensuring Research Integrity in Ireland, having regard to the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, the Universities Act, 1997, and the statutes and policies of the University. In particular, it is not the intention of the University that this policy should undermine academic freedom, as defined in the Universities Act, 1997, under Section 14.

## 2. Definitions

## 3. Scope

## 4. Principles

## 4.1 Principles of research integrity and research misconduct

The principles of research integrity include, but are not restricted to, the following (as presented in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, 2017):

- Reliability in  ensuring the quality of research, reflected in the design, the methodology, the analysis and the use of resources
- Honesty in  developing,  undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research in a transparent, fair, full and unbiased way
- Respect for  colleagues,  research  participants,  society,  ecosystems,  cultural  heritage  and environment
- Accountability for the research from idea to publication, for its management and organisation, for training, supervision and mentoring, and for its wider impacts.

Breaches  of  research  integrity  or Research  Misconduct take  many  forms  and  can  be  of  varying seriousness. As outlined in the European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity, 2017 and the National policy statement on Ensuring Research Integrity in Ireland, three of the most serious such breaches, which are classified as research misconduct, are:

- Fabrication of data: making up results and recording or reporting results that are known to be fabricated.
- Falsification of data: manipulating research, materials, equipment or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
- Plagiarism: the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving  appropriate  credit,  including  those  obtained  through  confidential  review  of  others' research proposals and manuscripts.

In addition to these, and drawing again from the European Code and the National policy statement, there  are  types  of  unacceptable  practices  which,  while  not  as  serious  as  the  above  in  individual instances, may be in the aggregate potentially as damaging to the overall reputation and integrity of research  and/or  the  researcher(s).  Serious  or  repeated  instances  of  such  practices  can  constitute research misconduct. These practices include but are not confined to:

- Data-related  practices :  e.g.  not  preserving  primary  data,  poor  data  management  and/or storage;
- Publication-related  practices :  e.g.  claiming  undeserved  authorship,  denying  authorship  to contributors, artificially proliferating publications;
- Personal  behaviours :  e.g.  significant  deficiencies  in  supervision  of  the  next  generation  of researchers and scholars, inappropriate personal behaviour;
- Financial and other malpractice : e.g. peer review abuse, non-disclosure of a conflict of interest, misrepresenting credentials; and/or
- Research procedures : e.g. harmful or dangerous research methods.

Note that research misconduct does not include honest error.

## 4.2 Principles that underpin transparent, fair and effective procedures to deal with allegations of research misconduct

It is imperative that when an allegation of research misconduct arises, suitable procedures are in place to deal with it effectively and fairly. UCD has a responsibility to the researchers it employs, and there needs to be appropriate protection for the rights and interests of all parties. There must be accountability when  things  go  wrong  and,  where  allegations  are  upheld,  appropriate  action  must  be  taken.  The response to any incidence of misconduct must be proportionate to the seriousness of the misconduct.

UCD commits to the principles for investigations as set out below.

## Integrity of the process 1

- Investigations of research misconduct allegations must be fair, comprehensive and conducted as expediently as is feasible without compromising accuracy, objectivity and thoroughness;
- Those parties involved in the procedure must ensure that any interests they have which might constitute a conflict of interest are disclosed and managed;
- Detailed and confidential records should be maintained on all aspects of the procedure; and
- Measures should be taken to ensure that investigations are carried through to a conclusion.

## Fairness

- Investigation of research misconduct allegations should be conducted in a manner that is fair to all parties and in accordance with relevant laws;
- Persons accused of research misconduct must be given full details of the allegation(s) in writing and allowed a fair  process for  responding  and  to  have  a  representative  or  work  colleague present for any meeting or interview associated with the investigation;
- Proportionate  action  should  be  taken  against  persons  found  to  have  committed  research misconduct; and
- Any final decision that has adverse outcomes for a person shall be subject to a right of review.

## Uniformity

- Procedures for dealing with misconduct should be articulated in sufficient detail to ensure the transparency and consistency of the process.

1  Please see the 'UCD Procedure for the Investigation of Misconduct in Research' document for full procedural details of any investigation into potential research misconduct.  It is expected that allegations of potential misconduct relating to minor research assignments undertaken by students on taught programmes will generally be handled in the first instance under the UCD Student Code of Conduct, unless the research appears in the published literature, is externally funded or is otherwise of a significance that merits handling through the aforementioned procedure.

## Confidentiality

- The procedure should be conducted in  a confidential manner, subject to certain disclosure requirements  in  accordance  with  UCD's  Procedure  for  the  Investigation  of  Misconduct  in Research;
- If  the  university  and/or  its  staff  have  legal  obligations  to  inform  third  parties  of  research misconduct allegations, those obligations must be fulfilled at the appropriate time and through the correct mechanisms; and
- Where possible, any disclosure to third parties should be made on a confidential basis.

## No detriment

- Anyone who is the subject of a research misconduct allegation is presumed innocent;
- No person should suffer  any penalty before,  during or  after  an  investigation  for  making  an allegation of research misconduct in good faith, but action should be taken against persons found to have made allegations in bad faith; and
- Appropriate restorative action, in consultation with the respondent of the allegation, should be taken when an allegation of research misconduct is not upheld.

## Equality Diversity &amp; Inclusion

- The procedures to investigate an allegation of research misconduct shall uphold the University's strategic  commitment  to  Equality  Diversity  and  Inclusion  (EDI)  and  no  individual  under investigation  shall  be  negatively  impacted  as  a  result  of  their  membership  of  a  group represented under the ten University EDI grounds.

Full procedural details for carrying out any investigation into potential research misconduct are outlined in UCD's Procedure for the Investigation of Misconduct in Research.
