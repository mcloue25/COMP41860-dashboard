UCD Research &amp; Innovation, UCD HR

## 1. Purpose

This policy describes the circumstances under which academic staff may engage in external work, either in their own right or on behalf of the University. Academic staff are Full Professors, Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors/Lecturers who have an academic contract. It outlines the criteria which govern both circumstances and the associated approval and reporting mechanisms which apply. The work and activity that is covered by this policy is that which is done during the academics normal working week.

UCD permits members of the academic staff to engage in external consulting in order to expand and maintain their professional competence, keep abreast of developments and innovation in business and the professions, and to support the Irish economy and enhance the reputation of the University by sharing the University's scientific and academic knowledge with the business community and the professions.

In the interests of transparency and accountability, it is important that the University should be aware of the commercial and professional interests of its academic staff and that formal approval has been given for external consulting, directorships and other external work. Academic staff are appointed on the understanding that they may engage in outside work, whether paid or unpaid, only with the permission of the President, or their nominee, on the recommendation of the Head of School (academic publications and occasional lectures excepted). For the purposes of this Policy, the President's nom inee is the relevant College Principal or VicePresident.

## 2. Definitions

## Categories of External Work

There are two broad categories of external work covered under this policy:

- University Consulting
- External work undertaken in a private capacity

## 2.1 Definition of University Consulting

For the purpose of this policy, University Consulting is on the basis of a contractual arrangement with a third party facilitated by ConsultUCD from which revenue is received by the University. Academic staff may make a claim, to their Head of School, against the net revenue received by the University to support their university research related activities.

UMT 21 June 2022

University Consultancy means part-time service as a professional or technical advisor. University Consultancy tends to be client driven and involves the use of the academic's professional capability to further the interests of the client. Examples include:

- Providing advice and expertise to a business project
- Assisting with strategic initiatives and planning
- Reviewing strategy and policy
- Expert witness or expert report services
- Development of bespoke training
- Serving on advisory boards or external committees
- Providing access to specialist research facilities or routine testing

For clarification, University Consulting is different to contract research. Assistance to help academics identify the correct classification for the proposed work is available from either ConsultUCD or UCD Research. University Consulting work does not generally include inter-institutional academic activities that are central to the organisation of academic life, such as external examining, peer review, membership of academic review, quality review or interview panels, invited lectureships, organisation of journals and conferences, etc., some of which may attract a small honorarium.

## 2.2 Definition of eternal work undertaken in a private capacity

There are two types of external work undertaken by staff in a private capacity:

- I. Private Consulting (Devlin Time)
- II. Pro Bono Activity
- I. Private Consulting (Devlin Time). This activity is defined as work which is undertaken by an academic member of staff on a purely private basis, without recourse to any form of university resources, facilities or insurance indemnification. The remuneration element of this work is a matter which is private to the staff member and the entity on whose behalf s/he is undertaking the work.
- II. Pro Bono Activity. This activity is defined as work which the staff member undertakes on an unpaid basis and which relates to the staff member's discipline (e.g. where professional advice in the discipline is offered  on  a  pro  bono  basis  to  voluntary  organisations  /  relevant  individuals).  It  does  not  include general community or social based work which does not relate to the staff member's area of expertise.

## 2.3 Definition of Academic Staff

Academic staff are Full Professors, Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors/Lecturers who have an academic contract.

## 3.  Scope

This policy applies to all full-time and part-time academic staff of the University. The 20% cap associated with Devlin time for both external work and university consulting applies and must be prorated for staff on parttime contracts. Engaging in external work without prior approval is in breach of university policy.

Members of staff should note that it is not permitted to carry out private trading or consulting activities from university premises without the express permission of their College Principal or relevant Vice-President, nor to imply any association with the University of a private trading or consulting activity.

## 4. Roles and responsibilities

## Annual return:

All full-time and part-time academic staff members are required to complete an annual return to their College Principal or Vice-President regardless of whether they have engaged in (or continue to engage in) external work covered by this policy. Each College Principal or Vice-President will write to staff in January each year and the return must be made by the end of February. Failure to submit the annual return is in breach of university policy. The Annual Return must be made via Consultancy &amp; External Work Approval System in UCD InfoHub.

## Disclosure of Interest:

A member of staff seeking permission to become involved in the ownership or control of a private company must disclose to their Head of School/Institute as well as their College Principal and the Vice President for Research, Innovation &amp; Impact the extent of his/her involvement and the nature and volume of any transactions between the University and the company.
