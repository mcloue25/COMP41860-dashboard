|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Introduction

This document outlines the approved procedures for the appointment of a Head of Subject, the reappointment of a Head of Subject, and the extension of an existing Head of Subject appointment. These procedures were last updated and approved by the Academic Council Executive Committee at its meeting on 26 September 2018.

## Context

All subjects are required to have a Head of Subject, approved by Academic Council or its Executive Committee. When a new subject is proposed, and a Head of Subject is required, the Procedures for the Emergence/Review of Subjects should be consulted in conjunction with this document to ensure the new subject undergoes appropriate approval.

Head of Subject is a fixed term role normally up to three years, with the option to extend by two years. In some cases, the Head of School will act as Head for one or more subjects and in such cases, the respective appointments are coterminous.

The identification of subjects within the University does not imply that there must be a Professor appointed in that subject.

All Head of Subject appointments, including extensions, re-appointments and instances where the Head of Subject appointment and Head of School appointment is coterminous, should follow the below procedures for approval.

## Procedures for the Appointment of a Head of Subject

1.  The Head of School, having consulted within the School and, where appropriate, across Schools, recommends a candidate for the role of Head of Subject to the College Principal.
2.  The College Principal discusses the recommendation with the Head of School, ensures that reasonable and appropriate consultation has taken place within the School, and where appropriate, across Schools.
3.  Where the College Principal supports the nomination, the New Head of Subject Nomination Form should be completed and submitted to the Academic Council, or its Executive Committee, for approval. This form also applies in the instance of re-appointment of a Head of Subject (for a three-year term), and where a Head of Subject appointment is coterminous with a Head of School appointment.
4.  Where the proposed Head of Subject has completed a three-year term, and the College Principal supports the intention to extend this term for two years, the Extension of Term of Head of Subject Form should be completed and submitted to the Academic Council, or its Executive Committee, for approval.

5.  Where approved, confirmation of appointment is sent by the Academic Council to the Head of Subject. This correspondence will include the role description for the Head of Subject and details of the term of appointment.
6.  The Academic Council, supported by University Secretariat, is responsible for the maintenance of the UCD Subject Register, which lists current Heads of Subject.
7.  The UCD Subject Register for a given academic year will be presented to Academic Council at the first meeting of that academic year, typically in November.
