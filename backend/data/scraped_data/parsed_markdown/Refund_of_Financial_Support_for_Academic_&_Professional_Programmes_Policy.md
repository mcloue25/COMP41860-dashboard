## Refund of Financial Support for Academic &amp; Professional Programmes Policy

## 1. Policy Summary

This  policy  deals  with  a  staff  member  being  funded  by  their  school/unit,  to complete  an  academic  or  professional  qualification.  These  qualifications should  be  linked  to  the  staff  member's  professional  development.  The school/unit  covers  the  cost  of  these  courses  out  of  the  local  budget  at  the discretion of the Head of School/Unit.

The course of study should be requested by the staff member as opposed to a qualification the school/unit has requested the staff member to complete.

In  the  case  of  resignation/contract  ending,  a  fee  claw  back  will  apply  within certain timeframes.

## 2. Purpose of Policy &amp; Definitions (Payment Conditions)

The purpose of the policy is to ensure the school/unit is refunded any monies paid  on  behalf  of  a  staff  member  who  resigns/contract  ends  within  the timeframe set out in the policy.

Payment  of  fees -  This  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  Head  of  School/Unit. Available budgets, relevance of the course of study etc. should be considered. If  the  Head  of  School/Unit  approves  a  staff  member  to  complete  a  relevant academic or professional course, half of the fees will be paid upfront by the staff member and will be reimbursed by the school/unit on an annual basis or when the course is completed. The other half of the fee will be paid upfront by the  school/unit.  As  agreed  at  school/unit  level  this  provides  for  payment  of registration fees, exemption fees, course fees and examination fees.

Relevant documentary evidence must be presented to the Head of School/Unit in support of any request for payment of fees. The staff member must pass the modules successfully to be reimbursed. Repeat exams will not be paid for by the school/unit.

## Fee claw back -

- i. If  the staff member resigns/contract ends while completing the course they must refund all such expenditure.
- ii. If the staff member resigns/contract ends within one year of completion*; they must refund two-thirds of such expenditure.
- iii. If the staff member has not finished the course after 3 years of when it was scheduled to be completed, they will be required to refund fees to their school/unit; unless there are extenuating circumstances for noncompletion.

*Completion refers to the date of notification of passing final exams and of the final result from the college/institution with which the staff member is studying.
