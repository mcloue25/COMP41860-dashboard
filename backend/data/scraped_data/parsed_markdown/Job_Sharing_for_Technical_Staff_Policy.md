## Job Sharing for Technical Employees Policy

Policy owner: UCD HR

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of a job sharing scheme is to allow permanent full-time employees to opt for a more flexible working arrangement for a temporary/indefinite period in order to facilitate the balancing of work with other commitments. Many people have responsibilities which make it difficult for them to continue to work on a full-time basis for particular periods of their lives. They do however wish to continue their careers and welcome the chance to use their skills and experience on a part-time basis.

The following policy is based on an agreement between UCD and UNITE, the trade union for these grades.

## 2.Definitions

Job Sharing is a way of working where two people voluntarily share the duties of one Full-Time post between them. Each job sharer receives a pro-rata salary and conditions for the proportion of time worked.

## 3.Scope

This policy applies to permanent, full time Technical employees of the University who have been in a permanent post for one year or more. However, this does not preclude the appointment of a suitably qualified technical officer from outside the University to a job sharing post.

## 4.Principles

- 4.1. The University in consultation with the Head of School/Unit will determine whether a post is suitable for job sharing.
- 4.2. The University/Head of School/Unit cannot guarantee a job sharing facility to all interested employees, but all applications will be fairly considered.
- 4.3. An employee who wishes to have their job considered for job sharing, should apply initially to the Head of School/Unit. The Head of School/Unit will then consider this application - in consultation with UCD HR - and the final decision will be communicated to the applicant.
- 4.4. In the event that an application for job sharing is not agreed the applicant will receive a written explanation of this decision from the Head of School/Unit.
- 4.5. If it is decided that a post is unsuitable for job-sharing, that post holder would still be eligible to apply as a job-sharer for any other suitable job sharing post advertised.
- 4.6. If it is agreed that a post is appropriate for job sharing, applications will be invited from other suitably qualified full-time staff of the University In the event of the non-availability of an internal job sharing partner, the appointment of someone who is not currently full-time and permanent, to a job sharing post, will be considered. An assessment process will take place to select the job sharing partner.

- 4.7. If no suitable partner can be found, the post will remain fulltime and the current postholder will be advised accordingly. That member of staff would still be free to apply as a job sharing partner for any other suitable job sharing post advertised. Further, they can re-apply for their existing post to be considered for job-sharing one year from the date on which they were notified that no suitable partner could be found.
- 4.8. Job sharers will be offered the opportunity to job share for one year initially on a pilot basis, at the end of which they must either commit to job sharing for an indefinite period, with their return subject to Section 5 below, or return to work on a full-time basis.
- 4.9. If the job sharer opts to return to work full-time after one year, their job-sharing partner will also return to their full-time position at the end of that year. If the job sharing partner was appointed on a contract from outside the University, then the appointment will terminate. If a contract employee was appointed to a full-time vacancy arising from the appointment of a job sharing partner from within, that appointment will terminate.
- 4.10. If the job sharer opts, at the end of the pilot period, to remain on indefinite job sharing, the other part of the job and any subsequent vacancy will be filled in accordance with the provisions outlined above.
- 4.11. Job sharers may be appointed to share one job which is divided between two or more Schools/Units. This would be equivalent to a current full-time job which is divided between two or more locations.
- 4.12. Where it is agreed that two permanent staff from different Schools/Units will share one post, the technical officer position vacated will then be processed through the appropriate College mechanisms and considered for filling in the same way as any other vacancy arising from a resignation or retirement.
- 4.13. Where it is agreed that two permanent staff from different Schools/Units will share a post in one of these Schools/Units, the corresponding vacant technical officer post in the other School/Unit will likewise be processed - as above.
- 4.14. The University will not use job sharing as a mechanism for reducing the total number of technical officer posts.

## 5.Conditions of Service

- 5.1. Conditions of service that apply to the permanent full-time post will be shared on a pro-rata basis between the two job-sharers. Job sharers are bound by the existing conditions of employment including all policies and procedures and legal requirements.
- 5.2. Job sharers will retain the same benefits under the relevant pieces of employment legislation as they would enjoy if working in a full-time capacity. In relation to all other conditions of service, no special arrangements will apply in the case of job sharing staff.
- 5.3. Job Content and Description: Job Sharers are sharing a single full-time job which will retain the job description, in terms of duties and responsibilities, of the job as a whole.
- 5.4. Attendance Arrangements: The principle governing attendance arrangements under this scheme is that two staff members will share equally the normal working hours of the single, full-time post, in accordance with the agreed working arrangement. The actual working arrangements will be agreed by the Head of School/Unit and the job sharing partners, taking into account the needs of the School/Unit. These may include:
- 2.5 days per week
- 3 days one week/ 2 days the following week
- All mornings every week
- All afternoons each week
- Half the daily/ weekly hours of full-time staff
- Week-on/ week-off

It may be desirable, in some jobs, to arrange for some overlap in working hours between the job share partners. This would be subject to discussion and agreement between the job sharers and the Head of School/Unit.

- 5.5. Pay: For each post in which job share arrangements operate, the scale of pay applicable to job sharers will be 50% of the appropriate point of the scale applying to the post. Increments on this scale will be granted annually.
- 5.6. Superannuation: The superannuation benefits of job sharers will be pro-rata to those of full time employees, on the basis that each year of job sharing will count as six months service for superannuation purposes.
- 5.7. Annual Leave: Job sharers are entitled to half the annual leave they would be entitled to if working on a full-time basis. Depending on the working arrangements, this could be calculated as half the number of full days, or the full number of half days, e.g. paid for 10 full days or paid for 20 half days.
- 5.8. Public and Privilege Holidays: Public and privilege holidays will be shared equally between job sharers. Where necessary, attendance will be varied by agreement with local management with a view to allowing both job sharing partners to benefit equally from public and privilege holidays. The application of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, with respect to the payment of public holidays to job sharers in UCD is as follows: Job Sharers, who work a split week, week on/off, or a variable pattern of full working days, are entitled from the operation of the Act, to an additional half day's pay for each bank holiday and privilege day that falls on a day where they are not scheduled to be at work. An employee may avail of a half day's pay leave in lieu of pay, subject to work requirements. Accordingly, back payment of an additional half day's pay will be applied to each job sharer not scheduled to be at work on a bank holiday or privilege day. As the pattern of job sharing in the University is variable, it is important that each employee consults with their Head of School/Unit, in order to advise UCD HR on the appropriate payment for a bank or privilege holiday. In order to ensure processing of monthly salaries, UCD HR should be notified at least six weeks in advance of the holiday.
- 5.9. Sick Leave: The sick leave entitlements of job sharers will be pro-rata to their entitlements if they were working on a full time basis and will depend upon their PRSI status.
- 5.10. Maternity Leave: Maternity leave/pay entitlements of job sharers will also be pro-rata to their entitlements if they were working on a full time basis, and will depend upon their PRSI status.
- 5.11. Return to Full-Time Employment: A job sharer may, at any time, apply for suitable full-time vacancies which are advertised within the University. If one job share partner leaves the employment of the University or takes up another post, then the remaining job sharer may be offered the opportunity of taking the post on a full-time basis. If this does not suit the remaining job sharer and they wish to remain working on a job sharing basis, the University will advertise for a job sharing partner internally and/or externally.

If, however, the University/Head of School/Unit deems that the post is no longer suited to job sharing or if a suitable job sharing partner cannot be found, then the remaining job sharer may be required to take up the position on a full-time basis.

The University reserves the right to require individual job sharers to return to full-time work. Where this is the case, six months' notice to return to full-time employment will be given by the University. This right will not, however, be exercised in order to provide cover during the absences such as sick leave, annual leave or maternity leave of the job sharing partner. Where the job sharer requires to return to work on a full-time basis because of unforeseen or exceptional personal circumstances, the University will endeavour to facilitate a return to full-time work at the earliest possible date.

If, after at least one year's job sharing on a permanent basis a job sharer wishes to return to full-time employment with the University, then they should notify the University of this wish, giving as much advance notice as possible. The University will consider the returning job sharer for the first appropriate position which becomes vacant and which the University decides to fill. It may also be necessary for the returning job sharer to compete with other internal applicants for this full-time position.

- 5.12. Training and Development: The University will encourage job sharers to continue to develop their careers and will endeavour to ensure that job sharers have access to appropriate training and development opportunities and are encouraged to develop their skills on a continuing basis. Job sharers will be fully included in the University's PMDS procedures.
- 5.13. Promotion: Job sharing staff will be eligible for promotion on the same basis as full-time staff. While it may be possible in some cases for job sharing to continue on, an offer of promotion will normally be conditional on the job sharer concerned undertaking to perform the higher duties of the higher grade on the working arrangements relevant to the promoted post on a full-time basis.
- 5.14. Outside Employment: Job Sharers will be obliged to inform the University of any outside employment in order to establish whether there is any conflict of interest where appropriate approval must be sought, and in order to comply with the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.
