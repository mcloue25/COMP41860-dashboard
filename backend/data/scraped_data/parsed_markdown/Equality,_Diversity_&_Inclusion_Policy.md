## 1.0 Purpose

Our  University  community  is  made  up  of  a  wide  range  of  people  with  diverse  backgrounds  and circumstances, which we value and regard as a great asset. As part of our continued commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion, we strive to create an environment in which all members of our community  should  expect  to  be  able  to  thrive,  be  respected  and  have  a  real  opportunity  to participate in and contribute to University activities so that they can achieve their fullest potential.

Having  a  commitment  to  equality,  diversity  and  inclusion,  supported  by  the  University  strategy, brings many benefits including: attracting, retaining and developing students and employees leading to better performance, a sense of commitment, engagement and wellbeing, and the achievement of excellence.  To  ensure  that  each  person  feels  part  of  our  community,  the  University  has  six underpinning  values  driving  our  culture:  Excellence;  Integrity;  Collegiality;  Engagement;  Diversity; and Creativity.

The  University  is  seeking  to  lead  on  defining  Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  challenges  and identifying priorities and mechanisms to address these.

## 2.0 Definitions

Equality is ensuring individuals or groups of individuals are not treated less favourably, on the basis of  the  ten  University  grounds  (see  definitions  below).  Equality  seeks  to  advance  equality  of opportunity  in  access  to  employment  or  a  programme  of  study,  training,  development,  career opportunities etc without any direct or indirect discrimination, or conscious or unconscious biases.

Equity is concerned with promoting fairness so that everyone starts from the same place. This may include positive measures in order to achieve greater equality of outcome.

Diversity means  more  than  just  acknowledging  and/or  tolerating  difference.  Diversity  involves understanding, appreciating and embracing differences and practicing mutual respect for qualities and experiences that are different from the majority.

Inclusion is  a  sense  of  belonging;  feeling  respected  and  valued;  feeling  a  level  of  support  and commitment from others so that one can achieve their best at work and study.

## 1 Ten University Equality Grounds :

- o Gender (including gender identity): a person's gender identity including male, female, transgender or non-binary
- o Civil status: a person's civil status be it single, married, separated, divorced, widowed, civil partnered and formerly civil partnered
- o Family status: being a parent of a person under 18 years or the resident primary carer or parent of a person with a disability
- o Socio-economic-status: a combined economic and sociological measure economic and social position in relation to others, based on the income, education, and occupation of an individual and their family.
- o Sexual orientation: a  person's sexual orientation including gay, lesbian, bisexual and heterosexual
- o Religion: a person's religious belief, background, outlook or none
- o Age: a person's age, this does not apply to a person aged under 16
- o Disability: includes people with physical, intellectual, learning, cognitive or emotional disabilities and a range of medical conditions
- o Race: includes race, skin colour, nationality or ethnic origin
- o Membership of the Traveller community: recognised as an ethnic group

EDI mainstreaming: ensures that Equality, Diversity and Inclusion is embedded and mainstreamed into every aspect of University life which includes assessing the impact of our policies, procedures, practices and communications on equality, diversity and inclusion and how these promote EDI.

Universal Design: ensures that access and widening participation are promoted, supported and the responsibility of all. Fundamental to this approach is the belief that equality of access incorporates both entry to UCD and access to an inclusive learning and work environment, designed for the whole UCD community.

Recognition: underpins  Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  through  a  recognition  culture  in  the University where all students and employees feel acknowledged and valued for their contributions to the University and supported in their academic, career and personal development.

## EDI Awareness Raising and Consultation:

- o ensuring that all employees and students undergo appropriate equality training for their role and that everyone in the University community is aware of their personal responsibility to support and promote EDI;
- o ensure that employees, students and their unions' representatives are provided with appropriate  forums  e.g.  the  University  Equality  and  Diversity  and  Inclusion  Group and Employee and Student Networks, to discuss equality and diversity issues, raise any concerns and to involve the community in the development and delivery of our equality objectives;

1 9 equality grounds (excluding socio-economic status) are defined in the Employment Equality Acts. Socio economic status is enshrined in the Constitution and in the Universities Acts

- o ensure  that  the  EDI  Policy  and  EDI  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  is  communicated University-wide through a variety of channels, and are embedded into all aspects of University life. A detailed implementation plan will accompany this policy.

EDI  data  monitoring: have  an  effective  data  monitoring  and  analysis  process  that  supports  this policy.

Legislative compliance: ensuring that the University will apply this policy in compliance with and in the spirit of the relevant legislation.

Unconscious  Bias refers  to  one's  background,  personal  experiences,  societal  stereotypes  and cultural  context  which  can  have  an  impact  on  decisions  and  actions  without  one  realising. Implicit or unconscious bias happens by our brains making incredibly quick judgments and assessments of people and situations unconsciously using those biases.

## Legislation

There  are  different  legislative  measures  in  place  that  protect  people  from  discrimination.  The University will apply this policy in compliance with and in the spirit of the relevant legislation.

The Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 outlaw discrimination in a wide range of employment and employment-related areas. These include recruitment and promotion; equal pay; working conditions; training or experience; dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment. The main type of  unlawful  discrimination  involves  the  treatment  of  a  person  in  a  less  favourable  way  than another  person  is,  has  been,  or  would  be  treated  in  a  comparable  situation  on  any  of  the  nine grounds.

The Equal Status Acts 2000-2015, prohibit discrimination in the provision of goods and services, the provision of accommodation and access to education, on any of the nine grounds. The Acts outlaw discrimination in all services that are generally available to the public whether provided by the state or the private sector.

The Disability Act 2005 places a statutory obligation on public service providers to support access to services and facilities for people with disabilities.

The  Gender  Recognition  Act  2015  provides  a  process  enabling  trans  people  to  achieve  full  legal recognition of their true gender and allows for the acquisition of a new birth certificate that reflects this change. The Gender Recognition Act will allow all individuals over the age of 18 to self-declare their own gender identity.

The Public Sector Duty introduced under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2015 places a duty on public sector bodies to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote  equality  of  opportunity  in  the  treatment  of  its  employees  and  the  persons  to  whom  it provides  services,  and  protect  the  human  rights  of  its  members,  employees  and  the  persons  to whom it  provides  services.  In  the  case  of  the  University,  this  would  include  all  members  of  our Community.
