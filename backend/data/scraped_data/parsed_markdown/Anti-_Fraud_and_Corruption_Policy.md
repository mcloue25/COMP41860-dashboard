## Anti-Fraud and Corruption Policy

Policy owner Finance Office

Approval date and body 14 March 2023. UMT

University College Dublin (UCD) is committed to maintaining and upholding the highest standards of honesty, integrity, incorruptibility  and accountability.  UCD expects its community, including its staff and students, to conduct themselves to the highest standards in these matters and will not tolerate fraud or corruption in any way. Wrongdoing such as fraud or corruption, or the covering up of these, can have a devastating effect on our professional reputations, working relationships and morale and may result in criminal prosecution including under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and the Criminal Justice Act 2018. If a member of the UCD community believes that someone is or maybe involved in such illegal or improper activity, then they should report this to the UCD. The aiding or abetting of such activity may also  be a criminal offence and lead to criminal prosecution.

This policy operates in conjunction with other existing statutes, policies and codes of conduct, including the Disciplinary Statute (Statute 28), the Protected Disclosure Policy, the Conflict of Interest Policy and the Acceptable Use Policy. Where any allegation made under those policies could amount to fraud or corruption, then it will be dealt with in accordance with this policy. Likewise, reports or findings which are made pursuant to this policy will, where appropriate, form the basis of actions under those other instruments.

## 1. Purpose

This policy aims to:

- a) promote and support the University's culture of honesty, int egrity and professionalism by outlining the key principles in regard to fraud and corruption prevention and detection.
- b) provide information and guidance to the UCD Community on how to address suspicions of fraudulent activities.
- c) provide the mechanisms through which such matters will be dealt.

## 2. Definitions

Computer Fraud means the use of information technology equipment or systems (IT) to manipulate programs or data dishonestly (for example, by altering, substituting or destroying records, or creating spurious records), or where the use of IT was a material factor in the perpetration of fraud. Theft (e.g. hacking systems or utilising computer resources for purposes not authorised by the

owner) or fraudulent use of computer time and resources is included in this definition. These issues are also covered in the University's Acceptable Use Policy.

Corruption means the direct or indirect offering of, seeking for or accepting inducements, gifts, favours, payment or benefits in kind which may improperly influence the action of any person in relation to his or her office of employment, position or business. The corrupt person need not benefit directly from their deed; they may unreasonably use their position to secure or influence some advantage to another. Not reasonably taking action to prevent corruption, also amounts to corruption. For the purpose of this policy, corruption is not limited to that as defined in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 (see footnote 1).

Fraud means the use of deception with the intention of obtaining an advantage, avoiding an obligation or causing loss to another party. It includes acts such as deception, bribery, forgery, extortion, corruption, theft, conspiracy, embezzlement, misappropriation, false representation, concealment of material facts and collusion. Attempted fraud is necessarily treated as seriously as accomplished fraud. For the purpose of this policy, fraud is not limited to that as defined in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 (see footnote 2).

A non-exhaustive list of Fraud and Corruption , includes:

- misappropriation of UCD assets, including the unauthorised or illegal use of confidential or proprietary information;
- financial  fraud,  including  misrepresentation  of  expense  claims  and  the  creation  of  and payments to fictitious vendors;
- accepting or offering a bribe or accepting gifts or other favours under circumstances that might lead to the inference that the gift or favour was intended to influence an employee's decision-making while serving UCD;
- Colluding with vendors or 3 rd parties in providing preferred pricing, engaging in contract rigging, inflating invoices or raising invoices for which goods have not been received.
- blackmail or extortion;
- Computer Fraud;
- Identity Fraud;
- knowingly creating and/or distributing false or misleading financial reports;
- violation of the UCD's procedures with the aim of personal gain or to the detriment of UCD.

Fraud Response Panel means the panel constituted in accordance with this policy which has the responsibility of investigating, assessing and otherwise dealing with allegations of Fraud or Corruption.

HoU means the Head of Unit/Head of School of the area in which the suspected Fraud or Corruption is alleged to have occurred.

Initial Reporter means the person who initially suspects that Fraud or Corruption is occurring or may have occurred.

Footnote 1.The Criminal Justice Act 2018 creates the offence of active and passive corruption, defined as either directly

or indirectly corruptly offering/giving or corruptly requesting/accepting a gift, consideration or advantage as an inducement or reward for any person doing an act in relation to his or her office of employment, position or business.

Footnote 2. A person who dishonestly, with the intention of making a gain for himself or herself or another, or of causing loss to another, by any deception induces another to do or refrain from doing an act is guilty of an offence.

## 3. Scope
