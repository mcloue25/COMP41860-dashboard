Sponsor: Academic Council Committee Honorary Degrees and Major Awards ACCHDMA

<!-- image -->

In keeping with the University's Policy Management Framework, the Procedure for the award of UCD Honorary Degrees and Major Awards will comply with legislation and Codes of Practice and be consistent with existing University Statutes, Regulations, and other Policies.

## 1. Introduction

The Academic Council Committee on Honorary Degrees and Major Awards (ACCHDMA) authorises the award of honorary degrees and Ulysses Medals, and retains oversight of the award of major public awards on the delegated authority of Academic Council. The following procedure has been reviewed and approved by ACCHDMA.

## 2.  Who can nominate?

Any member of the  University  faculty  and  staff may propose a  nominee  for  an  Honorary Degree  or  Ulysses  Medal  to  the  relevant  College  Principal/Vice-President.  The  College Principal/Vice-President,  in  accordance  with  the  below  requirements,  will  submit  the application  to  the  ACCHDMA  Secretariat  by  the  advertised  submission  deadlines  for consideration  by  the  Committee.  The  President  may  make  proposals  directly  to  the Committee.

## 3. Nomination criteria

Honorary degrees are conferred on awardees based on one or more of the following criteria:

- a) To  recognise  distinguished  individuals  for  their  sustained  excellence  in  scholarly, scientific or artistic endeavour.
- b) To recognise outstanding professional or philanthropic activity to advance the public good.
- c)  To recognise a significant connection to the University in some capacity.

The Ulysses Medal is  the  highest academic honour that the University can bestow and is awarded to those whose work has made an outstanding global contribution.  The Medal was inaugurated  as  part  of  UCD's  sesquicentennial  celebrations  in  2004  and  celebrates  the creative brilliance of our alumnus James Joyce.

In choosing recipients for these honours the University shall be mindful of the reputational benefit that may arise from its association with persons of singular distinction and probity. In that  sense,  honorary  degrees  and  Ulysses  Medals  honour  both  the  recipients  and  the institution.  Before  agreeing  to  confer  an  honorary  degree  or  Ulysses  medal,  ACCHDMA should satisfy itself that the recipient and their achievements reflect the ethos, vision, and values of UCD. College Principals and Vice-Presidents are urged to exercise discretion when submitting the final list of nominees, being cognisant of the status of these awards.

Individuals proposed must demonstrate one or more of the following attributes, either in their own right, or in a representative capacity:

## Honorary Degrees:

The categories of Honorary Degrees available for award as per the National University of Ireland (NUI) categories are as follows:

- -Doctor of Arts (DArts)
- -Doctor of Celtic Studies (DLittCelt)
- -Doctor of Economic Science (DEconSc)
- -Doctor of Education (DEd)
- -Doctor of Engineering (DEng)
- -Doctor of Fine Arts (DFA)
- -Doctor of Laws (LLD)
- -Doctor of Literature (DLitt)
- -Doctor of Medicine (DMed)
- -Doctor of Music (DMus)
- -Doctor of Science (DSc)

## Selecting the appropriate Honorary Degree award category:

Three award categories can also be proposed for a generic award: LLD, DLitt and DSc. A generic award category should be selected for a candidate whose achievements are not based on academic merit. For candidates who have distinguished themselves in an academic field, a specific award category reflecting the specific discipline should be selected.

## Ulysses Medals:

- Distinction in the arts, science or other field of scholarship or creativity

The University does not award honorary degrees or Ulysses Medals to current faculty or staff or to serving members of the Governing Authority or other University boards or bodies and does not award degrees or the Ulysses medal posthumously or in absentia .

## 4. Nomination procedure

Normally twice a year, in October and April, the President will issue a call to all faculty and staff, inviting them to prepare nomination proposals for the award of honorary degrees and Ulysses Medals. Proposals forms are submitted directly to the relevant College Principal, or Vice-President in the case of support units.

College  Principals  or  Vice-Presidents  will  review  the  proposal  so  that  a  case  may  be presented to the Committee. The mechanism for advance review is a matter for the individual College/Support Unit to determine provided the process is robust, clear, and in accordance with local GDPR procedures and is reflective of the data protection principles outlined under section 10 of these Procedures.

Prior  to  submission  to  the  Committee,  the  College  Principal/Vice-President  must  seek confirmation from the College Vice-Principal for Equality, Diversity and  Inclusion (EDI) or

equivalent person that the proposed nominees align with the EDI mission of the University. Nominations from each College/Unit should comprise no more than 50% of any one gender.

The submission of a given proposal by a College Principal/Vice-President implies that the merits of a case, its financial implications and its alignment with the University's EDI mission have been considered in full and that they are in a position to present the case to the Committee. College Principals/Vice-Presidents reserve the right to defer submissions to a future meeting of the ACCHDMA, for example, in instances where an excess of nominations for any one gender are received.  In such a case personal data collected should not be reused without updating it to assure the proposal is up-to-date and correct.

Where the Principal or Vice-President does not approve the nomination, they should inform the proposer. The proposer may at their discretion submit the proposal directly to University Secretariat for consideration by the committee noting that endorsement was not forthcoming from the College Principal or Vice-President.

Proposals  must  be  submitted  on  the  pro  forma  template,  by  the  submission  deadline advertised in the President's call. At all stages of the nomination process, confidentiality must be strictly observed. As such, proposers must not:

- Notify nominees in advance of the meeting;
- Communicate with nominees with regard to their nomination in any way;
- Share personal data of nominees (for example, contact details) in advance of the ACCHDMA  meeting.  Proposers  may  need  to  provide  a  postal  address  if  the nomination is approved. Under no circumstances should a postal address be provided as part of the nomination process.

Where a nominee is resubmitted for consideration after having not been approved previously by the Committee, University Secretariat will include the minute of the Committee's original deliberation, to accompany the resubmitted nomination to the Committee.

## 5. Formal Consideration of Nominees

Ahead of meetings of ACCHDMA, University Secretariat will circulate all valid nominations (i.e.  those  submitted  by  appropriate  deadlines  and  on  relevant  documentation)  and supporting  documentation  received  to  members  of  the  Committee  for  advance  review (normally, no later than ten days before a scheduled Committee meeting). In the interest of protecting decision-making, University Secretariat will redact the name of the proposer for each award on these documents.

In each case, the Chair will appoint a member of the Committee to act as an 'Independent Commentator' to consider a given nomination in greater detail, to satisfy the Committee that the nomination is valid, that the nominee meets the criteria outlined, and that their achievements reflect the ethos,  vision and values of the institution.  The 'Independent Commentator' reports are based on publicly available information and will be circulated to the Committee, along with nominees' nomination papers, ahead of formal meetings.

ACCHDMA normally meet twice per academic session following a call for nominations issued  by  the  Presidentand  will  consider  all  proposals  as  prepared  by  University

Secretariat. Where a significant number of proposals are received, it may be necessary to convene  a  preliminary meeting of ACCHDMA  for  the  purposes  of prima facie consideration. The Committee reserves the right to defer consideration on a nomination to a future meeting.

Where the Committee considers that awarding an honorary degree or major award in a certain instance might prove controversial, a risk assessment exercise may be undertaken by a sub-committee of ACCHDMA and consideration of any affected nomination shall be postponed.  The  risk  assessment  should  concern  itself  with  the  factors  giving  rise  to concern in a generic sense and it should not focus on a particular candidate or candidates. The sub-committee will present its final recommendation to ACCHDMA for consideration.

Proposals will be considered with reference to the criteria outlined in section 3 above, and the final list of approved candidates will wherever possible be broadly representative of discipline, gender, age and nationality.  A proposal to award an honorary degree will be approved in accordance with the Committee's terms of reference.

Normally, no more than one candidate will receive an award at each conferring ceremony.

The Committee reserves the right to rescind an Honorary Degree or Ulysses Medal at any stage following award.

## 6. Electronic Consultation of ACCHDMA

Only nominees for Ulysses Medals are to be considered electronically by ACCHDMA, and only in exceptional circumstances with the approval and at the discretion of the Chair. The imminent presence of a potential candidate on campus will not normally be considered an exceptional circumstance for the expedited award of a Ulysses Medal.

Nominees  for  Ulysses  Medals  which  do  not  fall  within  the  usual  meeting  cycle  of ACCHDMA  should  be  submitted  to  University  Secretariat  stating  the  reasons  for  its submission outside of the normal cycle. University Secretariat will obtain an Independent Commentator report as per normal procedure and the ACCHDMA membership will be consulted via email by University Secretariat within a schedule approved by the Chair. Communication of decisions made by electronic consultation will  follow  the  procedure outlined below.

## 7.  Communication of ACCHDMA Decisions

As outlined in Section 4 above, no communication should take place between the proposer and the nominee. Follow up communication is completed centrally in accordance with the below agreed steps.

Note  that  there  is  no  standard  timeline  within  which  Honorary  Degrees  and  Ulysses Medals are awarded to approved nominees.

In the case of nominees not approved for award by ACCHDMA, University Secretariat will communicate the decision formally to the appropriate College Principal, Vice-President, or  proposer (in case of direct nomination) as soon as possible after the meeting. The College Principal or Vice-President will in turn communicate this decision to the original proposer, if appropriate.

## 8. Award of Honorary Degrees

Where a candidate recommended by the Committee is willing, and in a position to accept the degree, the University will usually confer the degree at the relevant discipline-specific graduation ceremony as determined by the Conferring Unit.

Honorary  degrees  conferred  at  scheduled  graduation  ceremonies  during  the  year  will allow these recipients to act as role models for the graduates of the discipline concerned, and  as  such  awardees  may  be  invited  to  give  an  address  at  the  relevant  conferring ceremony. It is not a requirement for approved nominees to present an address. Normally, each graduation ceremony held by the University will confer no more than one honorary degree on an individual from an associated College or discipline.

Where  a  candidate  indicates  that  they  will  accept  an  honorary  degree  and  is  to  be conferred, their candidacy will be brought to the attention of the next meeting of Academic Council and the next meeting of Governing Authority as an item for noting.

## 9. Award of Ulysses Medals

In  recognition  of  the  Ulysses  Medal's  status  as  the  highest  honour  bestowed  by  the University, nominating Colleges and Units should ensure that appropriate ceremony and procedure be followed in its award. College Principals or Vice Presidents (as appropriate) should  liaise  with  the  President's  Office  and  UCD  University  Relations  to  ensure  that sufficient weight and consideration is given to the conferring of such awards.

While the individual circumstances of Ulysses Medal events may vary between disciplines and environments, given the status of the award the following should be considered when planning events

- Where possible, the President should formally bestow the Medal on the awardee, and introduce them based on liaison with the appropriate College Principal/VicePresident
- Ulysses Medals should be bestowed at a special university event organised for the purpose of honouring the awardee

- Awardees should be invited to present an address, participate in an open interview, or otherwise engage  with an invited audience in a way  which formally demonstrates the status of the award and burnishes the reputation of the University
- University  Relations  should  work  with  the  appropriate  College  Principal/VicePresident  to  ensure  that  appropriate  and  productive  publicity  opportunities  are availed of around the award.
