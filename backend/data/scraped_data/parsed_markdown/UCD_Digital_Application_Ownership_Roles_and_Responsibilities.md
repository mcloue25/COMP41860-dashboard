## UCD Digital Application Ownership Roles and Responsibilities

Owner:

IT Services

## 1. Introduction

Clear ownership and associated responsibilities are key to good governance (setting direction and accountability) and the effective on-going management (executing and operating within that direction) of digital applications.

Every digital application must have both an Application Business Owner and an Application Technical Owner - typically a UCD unit or school that has the sufficient authority, skills, and resources to fulfil the role effectively.

These roles are supported by Application Business Contact and Application Technical Contact roles respectively - named UCD employees supporting the Owners as the primary contacts for the purposes of engaging with IT Services for maintaining UCD's Application Portfolio, a key element of enterprise architecture.

These are mandatory roles that help to ensure that digital applications are designed, deployed, operated and supported in a secure, sustainable, and compliant manner.

Agreement  and  assignment  of  these  roles  is  required  prior  to  acquiring,  deploying,  or developing a digital application.

The guidelines below are provided to assist in the assignment of these roles for new digital applications  being  introduced  and  to  retrospectively  identify  and  assign  ownership  and contacts for existing digital applications.

## 2. Terms and Definition

Digital  Application -  subsequently referred  to  as  ' Application '  in  the  context  of  this document  is  a  digital solution  that  provides  functionality  to  UCD's  community,  typically accessed through a web browser, mobile device, or desktop, or that provides functionality or capabilities to other applications.

Applications include on-premises hosted and cloud services; bespoke and package solutions; internally managed and externally managed by a third party; subscription and perpetual paid licences; as well as free or open-source solutions.

Examples  of  Applications  include  Banner  (student  system),  Brightspace  (student  virtual learning environment), Tableau (analytics and business intelligence tools), and Terminal 4 (websites).

Each application is categorised according to their scale;

- University wide -  Applications  implemented for  use  across multiple  schools  or units.
- Local - Applications implemented for use in one school or unit.

Additionally, applications fall into one of three classes based on their purpose;

- Enabling  Applications -  Solutions  supporting  specific  functions  and  activities enabling UCD's business capabilities and processes.
- Infrastructure  Applications -  Solutions  that  support  technical  operations  and processes within UCD.
- Learning/Teaching Applications - Course/discipline-specific software packages, supporting  teaching  and  learning,  or  taught  research  in  particular  academic domains or modules.

Foundational Platforms - are a specific class of application that provides a pre-integrated ecosystem of applications, or provides the capability to build new applications.

The platform itself and each application deployed on it must have an Application Business Owner which may all be different.

The Application Technical Owner of the platform is the Application Technical Owner for every application deployed on the platform.

This allows for effective business and technical decisions regarding the platform itself.

## 3. Scope

## In Scope

- Any Enabling Application, Infrastructure Application or Learning/Teaching application  irrespective  of  scale  or  class,  deployed  by  a  UCD  College,  School, Institute/Centre, Unit, Wholly Owned Subsidiary Company, or other organisational entities as designated by the UMT Digital Campus Group, that;
- enables or supports university business capabilities and processes.
- where UCD is the data controller or processor.

## Out of Scope

- Research Solution - software used by a researcher (or research team), for the delivery of a research project
- Personal Use Tools/Apps that individuals have personally enabled and use for their own  activities,  and  do  not  contribute  to  the  UCD's  business  capabilities  or processes.
- Applications  deployed  within  UCD  Licensee,  separate  legal  entities  to  UCD,  or incubator companies, for their own use.

## 4. Principles

1. Application Business Ownership and Application Technical Ownership is assigned at a  Unit/School  level  with  the  role  of  Head  of  Unit/School  taking  accountability  for ensuring that the Unit/School undertakes their responsibilities. Even where a third party o r  cloud  service  provider  is  involved,  ultimate  accountability  resides  with  UCD's Application Business Owner and Application Technical Owner. See Section 5 below on Application Owner Responsibilities .
2. Assignment of Application Owners and Application Contacts, and agreement on the responsibilities of each, must be in place before an application is acquired or deployed. While ownership assignments are expected to be persistent for the lifetime of the Application, where the purpose or scope of an Application significantly changes, then ownership may be transferred - see Section 6 below for Guidelines for Assigning Application Owners. Any changes should be agreed with the existing and proposed Business and Technical Owners.
3. Both  the  Application  Business  Owner  and  Application  Technical  Owner  and  their Contacts must have the sufficient authority, (financial and staff) resources, capabilities, and expertise to fulfil their respective roles effectively. Until all of these are in place or otherwise fully committed to be in place and relevant budget identified, no assignment

4. Information related to Application Ownership (including Application Business Owner, Application Technical Owner, Application Business Contact, and Application Technical Contact names and contact details) will be centrally recorded by IT Services to support UCD's enterprise architecture and application governance structures.
5. For  a  number  of  university-wide  and  foundational  platforms,  there  may  be  valid justification for separating the governance and management responsibilities - with the governance  responsibilities  assigned  to  a  UMT  SubGroup  or  other  application governance committee. Where this is done, a UCD Unit/School must still be identified as the  primary  business  stakeholder  and  be  assigned  as  the  Application  Business Owner to undertake the management responsibilities - see figure 2 in section 5.

## 6. Guidelines for Assigning Application Owners

## 6.1 Assigning an Application Business Owner

Application business ownership should be aligned, where possible, with the primary business stakeholder - i.e. the stakeholder with primary responsibility for the key business capability(s) supported by the application.

The following guidelines apply for identifying and assigning an Application Business Owner:

<!-- image -->

## UCD Digital Application Ownership Roles and Responsibilities

Owner:

IT Services

Approval Body &amp; Date:

UMT 16th Dec 2025

- (i) Where there is a single primary business stakeholder that UCD Unit/School will be assigned as the Application Business Owner
- (ii)  Where there is more than one primary business stakeholder then an agreement amongst the multiple business stakeholders should be made as to who will be the Application Business Owner.
- (iii)  In certain instances, for a number of university-wide and foundational platforms, there  may  be  valid  justification  for  separating  the  governance  and  management responsibilities and the governance responsibilities assigned to an existing governance  group,  such  as  a  UMT  SubGroup  or  other,  or  a  new  application governance committee may be established to take on the governance responsibility. See figure 3 above. When this is done, UCD Unit/Schools identified as the primary business stakeholder will be assigned as the Application Business Owner to undertake management responsibilities. Due to their nature, it is likely that IT Services is assigned the Application Business Owner of Foundational Platforms (e.g. Microsoft), which may be supported by an application governance group.
- (iv) Where it is not possible to agree an Application Business Owner by means of the above, the issue will be brought to the UMT Digital Campus Group for consideration.

## 6.2 Assigning an Application Business Contact

The Application Business Contact is a named UCD employee appointed by the Application Business Owner and should be in the Application Business Owner's line of command.

## 6.3 Assigning an Application Technical Owner

Application Technical ownership should be aligned, where possible, with the primary technical stakeholder.

The following guidelines apply for identifying and assigning an Application Technical Owner:

- (i) Where there is a single primary technical stakeholder that UCD Unit/School will be assigned as the Application Technical Owner
- (ii) Where there is more than one technical stakeholder, then an agreement amongst the technical stakeholders must be reached to select the Application Technical Owner
- (iii) Normally for University-wide applications and Foundational Platforms, the primary technical stakeholder is UCD IT Services. An exception to this rule is UCD Library for Library applications. The Application Technical Owner of a foundation platform will be

the Application Technical Owner for all applications enabled by the platform.

- (iv) For Local applications, the Application Technical Owner may be a Unit/School, or UCD Subsidiary.
- (v) Where it is not possible to agree an Application Technical Owner by means of the above, the issue will be brought to the UMT Digital Campus Group for consideration.

Where a Unit/School/Subsidiary does not have the necessary Technical Ownership skills to to deploy an application or manage an application on an ongoing basis, engagement with IT Services is recommended before acquiring or deploying a solution. Details of how to request an IT project are available on the IT Services webpage.

## 6.4 Assigning an Application Technical Contact

The Application Technical Contact is a named UCD employee appointed by the Application Technical Owner as the primary technical contact for the purposes of Enterprise Architecture and Application Portfolio Management.

They should be in the Application Technical Owner's line of command.

## 6.5 Dual Business and Technical Ownership

It is possible for one unit/school to hold the dual role of Application Business Owner and Application Technical Owner, if they are the main stakeholder for the business capabilities supported by the application and the main technical stakeholder. For example: Library is both  the  Application  Business  Owner  and  Application  Technical  Owner  for  the  Library Management System, IT Services is both the Application Business Owner and Application Technical Owner for the Google and Microsoft platforms.

## 7. Review of Ownership Roles &amp; Responsibilities

Review  of  this  Application  Ownership  document,  and  the  approach  for  assignment  of Application Business Owners and Application Technical Owners, will be overseen by the UMT Digital Campus Group.
