## 1. Purpose

-  To highlight the level of service offered by HR People &amp; Organisation Development

## 2. Definitions

Soft skills refer to skills such as, management, interpersonal and personal development skills that determine strength as a leader, supervisor, negotiator, conflict manager and project manager.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all employees in UCD who are responsible for their own or others learning and development. It is from the perspective of HR People &amp; Organisation Development and the soft skills training and development provided in the University.

## 4. Principles

Training  and  development opportunities are available to all  employees across the University. The Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion Policy aims to ensure that all members of the University are trained, appraised, given access to relevant work experience, promoted, and otherwise treated on the basis of their relevant merits, qualifications, abilities and experience.

Training  and  development  activities  organised  by  HR  People  &amp;  Organisation  Development  will usually take place during work time on Belfield or Blackrock campus.

There are many different types of activities that contribute to an individual's personal development and staff are encouraged to consider the range of opportunities available to them. Some activities are undertaken with the specific aim of enhancing skills and/or imparting information e.g. attending a seminar or training programme, reading, work-shadowing and mentoring. Other activities offering the potential for development, may arise in the course of normal work activity e.g. being involved in a secondment or project where the individual acquires new skills or knowledge or discussing how to deal with a particular problem with a colleague.

## 5.1 Funding for Training &amp; Development

The  budget  for  HR  People  &amp;  Organisation  Development  is  managed  within  the  HR  People Development  and  Organisation  Effectiveness Directorate.  The  cost  for  HR  People  &amp;  Organisation Development  programmes  is covered by the HR  budget and there is no charge to the individual/school/unit for programmes  offered  by HR  People &amp; Organisation  Development. However, a cancellation fee does apply in certain instances to those who confirm they are attending a programme and then cancel up to 10 days prior to the programme taking place http://www.ucd.ie/peopledevelopment/ for further information.

All  University  Schools  and  Units  have  independent  budgets,  and  these  can  be  used  to  support specific and specialised training and development requests within the school/unit with authorisation from the Head of School/Unit.

The University covers some of the cost of training through the internal training provider network (central funds) but it is recommended that a percentage of the school/unit budget, indicatively 1% be also set aside for specific training requests that cannot be met by the internal training providers.
