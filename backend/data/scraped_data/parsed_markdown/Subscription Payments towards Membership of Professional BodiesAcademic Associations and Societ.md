## Subscription Payments towards Membership of Professional Bodies/Academic Associations and Societies Policy

## 1. Policy Summary

The purpose of this policy is to outline the conditions relating to the payment of  membership  subscriptions  to  professional    bodies/academic  associations and societies and to ensure that the University policy on this matter complies with  changes  to  section  118  (5  e)  of  the  Taxes  Consolidation  Act  1997  as amended by the Finance Act 2011.  Under this change, Benefit-in-Kind (BIK) may  be  payable  on  membership  subscriptions  to  professional  bodies  and academic associations and societies.

## 2. Scope of the Policy

This policy applies to all staff.

## 3. Policy &amp; Procedures

Membership subscriptions to professional bodies and academic associations/societies can be paid on approval by a Head of School/Unit.  It is important  to  note  that  these  payments  will  (where  approved  by  a  Head  of School/Unit)  be  charged  to  the  School/Unit  budget  or  research  accounts which accept these payments as eligible costs.  Such subscriptions play an important role in maintaining academic/professional standards in  UCD. Where staff qualify for professional subscription payments, normally only one professional subscription per staff member will be paid.

## Subscriptions less than €250

In cases where the subscription fee cost is less than €250, these payments can  be  processed  without  BIK  (under  a  Revenue  small  benefit  exemption) through the standard claims procedure for 'vouched expenses' as set out on the  Bursar's  Office  website http://www.ucd.ie/bursar/forms.html or  can  be processed through the e-Procurement system.

## Subscriptions in excess of €250

Subscriptions in excess of €250 may in some cases,  be  subject to Benefit in Kind (BIK).  The Revenue Commissioners issued an eBrief in 2011 detailing three instances where the BIK requirement would not apply.

1.  There is a statutory requirement for membership of a professional body before an individual can carry out the duties of their employment
2.  Where  there  is  a  requirement  for  a  practicing  certificate  or  licence before they can carry out the duties of their employment
3.  Other situations where membership fees of a professional body may be deductible where the following conditions are satisfied:
- a.  The duties of  the  employee  and  the  duties  of  the  employment require the exercise or practice of the occupation or profession in respect of which the annual membership fee refers

- b.  The  employee  so  exercises  the  profession  or  practices  the occupation or profession in respect of which the annual membership fee refers; and
- c.  Membership  of  the professional body is an indispensable condition of the tenure of employment

A  small  number  of  staff  qualify  for  BIK  exemption  for  their  professional subscriptions  under  headings  1  and  2.    These  exemptions  apply  to  the  inhouse solicitor, GPs employed in the General Practice area in the School of Medicine  and  veterinary  practitioners.    Staff  that  fall  into  this  category  can have  their  subscriptions  paid  through  with  the  standard  vouched  expenses claim process as outlined above.

Under  heading  3,  professional  subscription  payments  can  only  be  exempt from  BIK  if  membership  of  the  relevant  body  is  specifically  detailed  in  an individual's contract as 'an indispensible condition of the tenure of employment'.  The Budget Review Committee has set out that contracts for Accountants and Actuaries should reflect that professional membership is an indispensible  condition  of  employment.    Staff  that  fall  into  this  category  can have  their  subscriptions  paid  through  with  the  standard  vouched  expenses claim process as outlined above.

## Multiple subscriptions in excess of €250.

In  limited  cases,  staff  members  may  be  members  of  several  different associations/societies  where  the  total  cost  of  the  subscriptions  exceeds  the Revenue small benefit exemption of €250. In such cases, the total involved may be subject to BIK even if no individual subscription exceeds €250.

For subscriptions over €250 and in cases of multiple subscriptions, the Head of School/Unit will be asked to indicate (through the Professional Subscriptions  Application  Form)  whether  the  professional  membership(s) is/are  indispensible.    Once  this  has  been  confirmed,  the  staff  member  can submit  the  approved  Professional  Subscriptions  Form  (see  attached)  along with  the  standard  vouched  expenses  claim  form  available  on  the  Bursar's Office website http://www.ucd.ie/bursar/forms.html .

In circumstances where the Head of School/Unit deems the membership to be 'not  indispensible but desirable', these will  be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  It is important to note that staff that fall into this category will have to pay the BIK liability.

Where a Head of School/Unit deems that membership is not relevant to the role, then no payment will be made to the staff member.
