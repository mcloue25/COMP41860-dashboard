## 1. Purpose

- 1.1 To ensure that  students  are  eligible  to  continue  with  their  studies,  the  University  requires  satisfactory academic progress to be maintained. This requirement is set out in Academic Regulations 1 . The University recognises that there are many factors which may affect a student's academic progress. The Continuation -  Academic  Progress  Policy  describes  the  University's  approach  to  supporting  students  to  maintain progress and to identify those who may need additional support. It also provides procedures to be followed in instances where a student's academic performance and progression falls below the required standards.
- 1.2 Governing Boards are responsible for monitoring the overall performance of students registered to each programme under their remit. Academic Regulations for taught programmes state that a Governing Board shall review the performance of a student where the student fails to remediate a failed module after three attempts or where a student fails to achieve any additional standards for acceptable performance. Where a student's performance is deemed academically unacceptable, they may be referred to the Governing Board for review of their performance as a continuation case. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance about roles and responsibilities, and to set out the procedures that will be followed, in such cases.
- 1.3 The objectives of this Policy are to:
- a) ensure that the Academic Regulations concerning continuation and readmission are applied in a fair and transparent manner.
- b) provide a suitable framework for the effective, consistent and timely identification and management of continuation issues that may arise.
- c) provide the procedures to be followed where a student's academic performance and progression within their programme is deemed unacceptable.

## 2. Definitions

## 2.1 Discontinued

The registration status of a student who is deemed ineligible to continue in a UCD programme under the continuation process will be 'discontinued'.

## 2.2 Governing Board

Governing  Boards  are  established  by  Academic Council.

## 2.3 Return to Study

- 6.1 Due to the varying size and nature of taught programmes, programme areas may use different approaches to ensure that students at risk of failing to meet the required academic standards are identified and communicated with in a timely manner. Any programme-specific continuation procedures should be published and made easily accessible.

A series of incremental steps are commonly used by programmes, which are designed to support students at risk of failing to meet the required standards of progression. These steps provide students with a number of opportunities  to  engage  with  their  programme  in  order  to  remedy  their  situation.  Typical  actions  taken  by programme areas and schools include:

- Email alerts notifying students about failed modules.
- Written requests for students to attend meetings to discuss their academic performance and progress.
- The development of an academic plan. Progress against the plan will be monitored and there may be the need for subsequent meetings.
- 6.2 Where  a  student  fails  to  meet  the  requirements  set  out  in  Academic  Regulations  and/or  the  programme specification or has failed to respond to attempts by the programme to engage with the student about their performance, a recommendation for discontinuation of registration can be presented  to the Governing Board by  the  chair  of  the  Governing  Board  or  relevant  academic  committee.  The  student  should  be  given  the opportunity to withdraw voluntarily, or to avail of an exit award where appropriate and subject to compliance with the University's regulations and policies.
- 6.3 In  making  a  recommendation  for  discontinuation  of  registration,  Governing  Boards  shall  be  provided  with evidence that the student has been given sufficient opportunity to remediate their situation, and that they have been provided with all reasonable supports to assist them in any difficulties they may have, including academic and pastoral supports in the event that the student has availed of these supports . This may include:
- a) A  summary  of  communications  and  meetings  held  with  the  student,  including  copies  of correspondence with the student regarding their academic performance/progression and minutes or agreed actions or academic plans.

- c) In the case of a non-engaging student, an account should be provided of efforts made to offer supports and communicate with the student about their academic performance.
- d) In  exceptional circumstances, the Governing Boards may, where they are of the view that the information is required for the Board to make a fully informed decision, request information through the Chair regarding applications for extenuating circumstances. The information requested shall be no more than is necessary for the Board to make a fully informed decision and in the form of a summary document. The information shall only be provided to the Chair of the Governing Board and  who  will  provide  as  much  information  to  the  Board  as  they  consider  necessary  and proportionate in the circumstances. The student will be advised by the Chair that the information has been requested.
- 6.4   The Chair of the Governing Board shall notify the student in writing that the Governing Board is considering discontinuing a student's registration to their programme.

7. 6.7 Where a decision is made to discontinue a student, ACCSCC and UCD Registry (Administrative Services) shall also be notified in writing along with any other area of the University as may be appropriate and 'discontinued' should be recorded as the registration status on the student's record.
