Approval date and body

UMT 14 December 2021

## 1. Purpose

The main purpose of flexi-time is to provide a more flexible system of attendance for staff, within certain defined limits. It is a significant benefit to staff as it can allow them to accrue up to 13 days additional leave (Flexi-Leave) in a calendar year. Flexi-time is not a staff entitlement as it is subject to the operating requirements and approval of the Head of School/Unit.

## 2. Principles &amp; Definitions

It is important to note that flexi-time is different from 'flexible working arrangements' which also exist in the University. Flexible working arrangements include part-time working, job sharing, working greater hours during peak periods and reduced hours during slower times, working remotely/from home. Flexible working arrangements are not recorded on a flexi-time system and do not involve staff building up hours where they can take a 'flexi-day' leave.

Heads of Schools or Units who are considering flexible arrangements for their area are recommended to contact their HR Partner for additional advice and information on the various options and considerations. Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) support the implementation and maintenance of Flexi-Time in conjunction with the area Flexi-Time Administrator.

- 2.1 Flexible Bandwidth: The flexible bandwidth is the period of time during which flexi-time can be accrued by staff during any one working day. This is between 08.00 and 19.00.
- 2.2 Core Time: Attendance between 10.00 and 16.00 is mandatory, apart from lunchtime and coffee breaks. The lunch break will be of not less than 30 minutes duration and should be taken between 12.00 and 14.30. Clocking out and in will be required for lunch times even if staff are not leaving the office/desk area. Actual starting and finishing time work patterns must be agreed with the manager in line with the operational needs of the area.
- 2.3 Staff Working Hours: Staff Working Hours are the hours that staff must work as set out in the working hours matrix (Summary of change to working hours). These hours are pro-rata for Part-Time staff. All Staff Working Hours exclude lunch time. The maximum number of hours recorded that a staff member can work per day is 10.5 hours. If these hours change, the Policy will be amended.
- 2.4 Core HR: Core HR is the Human Resources Management information system used by UCD. Core Time and Attendance is one of the modules within the Core HR package and it is used to support the administration of flexible working arrangements.
- 2.5 Recorded Hours: The number of hours a staff member is in attendance and for which an approved record on Core HR has been kept.
- 2.6 Flexi-Period: The Flexi-Period is a period of 4 weeks in which staff work the required number of hours adjusted to take account for Flexi-Time pluses and negatives.

- 2.7 Flexi Balance: A staff member may vary the number of hours worked in each Flexi-Period for the purposes of accumulating hours, this is called Flexi Balance. A Flexi Balance (plus or negative) is carried forward to the next Flexi-Period up to a maximum of 8 hours. It is not permitted to carry forward hours in excess of 8 hours per 4-week period and excess hours will be forfeited.

In exceptional circumstances, where staff have been unable to take their Flexi-leave due to, for example, staff shortages, in excess of 8 hours may be carried forward with the agreement of the manager. In the unusual situation where a negative balance exists in excess of 8 hours in a 4week period then it must be settled within the period. It should be noted that negative balances are discouraged and must be considered as an exception.

- 2.8 Flexi-Leave: Flexi Balance plus is reduced by seeking up to one full day or two half days leave; this is called Flexi-leave. With effect from 1 July 2014, the maximum amount of flexi leave allowed in any flexi period is one day to a maximum of 13 days during the year. Flexi-leave can be taken by prior arrangement with the manager and will be subject to the needs of the team.

In exceptional circumstances, and with the approval of the manager, Flexi-leave may be taken in periods of less than half day, with a minimum of one hour. With prior agreement of the manager, flexi leave can be used to cover medical appointments during the standard working day with the exception of appointments that are unavoidable or for pregnancy consultations. Medical appointments during Core Time must be confined to cases of genuine emergency or necessity. Annual leave, public holidays, sick leave or any other authorised absence will be credited at the current full day or a half day rate as appropriate and will have no impact on flexi balance.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all categories of staff up to and including the grades of Administrative Officer 1A or equivalent only.

This is the only UCD Flexi-Time Policy for application to school/units employing administrative staff in UCD.

Existing Administrative staff above these grades employed before July 2013 with access to flexi-time retain the benefit on a personal to holder basis only if they remain in their current roles. If staff change roles they will lose all entitlement to Flexi-time.

Applications to implement Flexi-Time in a School/Unit must be completed and approved by the appropriate Head of School/ Unit and College Principal/Vice President.

## 4. Roles and responsibilities

It is important to understand and accept that sufficient staff must be available at all times, even outside Core times, to carry out operations in each team and that for Flexi-time to work, coordination, common sense and cooperation from all staff is absolutely essential. There is therefore an onus on staff as well as managers to ensure proper coverage during the current normal office hours. The roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders are outlined below.

- 4.1 Staff Member: Staff members must record their hours by clocking in via either Employee Self Service (ESS) or a clocking machine. The lunch break will be of not less than 30 minutes

duration and should be taken between 12.00 and 14.30. Clocking out and in will be required for lunch times even if staff are not leaving the office. Staff members must inform the Flexi-time Administrators of any adjustments (e.g. annual leave) to their time having sought approval from their manager. Staff members must ensure that their clock has been correctly updated each week.

- 4.2 Head of School/Unit/Line Manager: The role of the Head of school/unit/Line Manager is to approve and monitor hours worked and Flexi-Leave for his/her area. Flexi-time will be subject to maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of each School/Unit and will be subject to this policy. It is the responsibility of the manager of the School/unit to monitor flexi-time and if work appears to be suffering as a result of Flexi-time, then steps will be taken in consultation with HR to remedy the situation. If these steps fail to restore normal effectiveness, the scheme will be cancelled after due consultation with staff.
- 4.3 Flexi-Time Administrator: There are a number of aspects to a Flexi-time administrator's role:
- Recording Leave: All leave should be notified to and recorded by the administrator once it has been approved. This includes Annual Leave, Flexi-Leave, Parental Leave etc.
- Administration: Each week the administrator must verify a staff member's exceptions to ensure that they are correct.
- Out of Course Amendments: Each week there is the possibility that amendments from previous weeks were not carried out. The Out of Course Amendments process facilitates the correction of these previous weeks.
- User Administration: The administrator must also ensure that any new staff member in their area is set up correctly on Core Time and Attendance.
- HR Partners will provide advice and support to Heads of School/Unit/Line Managers in the implementation of Flexi-Time and/or any other flexible options under consideration. Heads of Schools or Units who are considering flexible arrangements for their area are recommended to contact their HR Partner for additional advice and information on the various options and considerations. HR Partners will provide advice on any staffing or management issues that may arise and how to address these .
- The UCD Human Resources Information Systems unit (HRIS) supports the implementation of CORE Flexi-time, assists with system issues and provides training. HRIS are also responsible for setting up shift types and patterns. Contact hrhelpdesk@ucd.ie

## 5. Abuse of System

All staff will be required to accurately record his/her attendance. Hours are recorded by clocking in or out from his/her PC or on-site clocking machines. A staff member, who is proven to be misusing the system will be liable to disciplinary action in accordance with existing procedures. Abuse of the system will result in the withdrawal of flexible working for any individual abusing the system. The manager may consider re-application after a suitable period of time has elapsed.

Clocking in and out must be completed at the staff member's desk, unless otherwise agreed with your manager.

All staff should clock in and out themselves. Staff should at no time clock in or out for another member of staff and by doing so would be in breach of UCD IT Services polices http://www.ucd.ie/itservices/itsupport/itsecurity-topic/
