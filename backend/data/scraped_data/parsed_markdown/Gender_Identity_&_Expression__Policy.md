## 5.0 Definitions

The words people use to describe themselves and others are very important. Using the incorrect words can (often unwittingly) undermine people's dignity and reinforce exclusion. When in doubt, asking a person how they self-identify is generally the most respectful approach.   The following are examples of some gender identities only, and do not capture all that exist.

Gender refers to expectations and stereotypes about behaviours, actions and roles linked to being a 'man' or 'woman.' Social norms related to gender vary across cultures and can shift over time.

Gender binary refers to the predominant social system whereby people are thought to be one of two genders: male or female. This system is restrictive for many people who feel that their natal sex

(sex they were labelled with at birth) does not match up with their gender or that their gender is fluid and not fixed Gender expression refers to how a person represents or expresses their gender identity to others, such as through behaviour, clothing, hairstyles, voice or body characteristics (See appendix 1). Gender  identity refers  to  each  person's  deeply  felt  internal  and  individual  experience  of  gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body. Gender identity is different from a person's sexual orientation. Gender Recognition Certificate: A certificate issued under the Gender Recognition Act 2015 which enables trans people's binary gender to be legally recognised from age sixteen. surgical interventions undertaken by some people as part of the transitioning process. It is a process that is undertaken under medical supervision for the purpose of reaffirmation of a person's sex by changing

Gender/Sex  affirmation  surgery , also called gender  confirmation  surgery,  refers  to physiological or other characteristics of sex.

Intersex refers to a number of different variations in a person's sex characteristics that do not match strict medical definitions of male or female. These characteristics may be chromosomal, hormonal and/or anatomical and may be present to differing degrees. Intersex people are typically coercively assigned  as  male  or  female  at  birth.  Some  intersex  people  identify  with  their  assigned  sex,  while others do not. Some choose to identify as intersex. Intersex people, like the general population, may or  may  not  identity  as  trans.  Trans  people  undergoing  transition  are  not  considered  to  have  an intersex condition as a result of their transition. (see transition below).

Non-binary and/or genderqueer describes any gender identity which does not fit within the binary of male and female. The term is not a synonym for trans and should only be used if someone selfidentifies as non-binary and/or genderqueer.

Sex  is  the  designation  of  a  person  at  birth  as  male  or  female  usually  based  on  their  anatomy  or biology Trans is an umbrella term referring to people with diverse gender identities and expressions that differ from stereotypical gender norms. It includes but is not limited to people who identify as transgender, gender non-conforming, non-binary or genderqueer. Trans is shorthand for 'transgender', however, 'transgender' should be used as an adjective, not as a noun. For instance 'transgender people' is appropriate but 'transgenders' or 'Mary is a transgender' could be viewed as disrespectful.

'Transition' refers to a process that entails living in one's actual gender identity rather than in the sex one was assigned at birth. The process generally occurs over a lengthy period of time and can include some or many of the following steps: telling one's family, friends, and colleagues; using a different  name  and  different  pronouns;  dressing  differently;  changing  one's  name  and/or  sex  on legal documents; hormone therapy; and possibly (though not always) one or more types of surgery. Transphobia is a term used to describe an aversion to, fear or hatred or intolerance of trans people and communities. Transsexual is a term for people whose gender identity is different from their assigned sex at birth and  who  seek  to  transition.  The  term  may  not  be  acceptable  to  many  members  of  the  trans community since it has clinical or medical overtones.

## Legislation

There are different legislative measures in place that protect people from discrimination arising from gender identity and gender expression.

Under the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 and the Equal Status Acts 2000-2015 discrimination, and  gender-related  harassment,  which  encompasses  gender  expression  and  gender  identity,  is unlawful.  The  main  type  of  unlawful  discrimination  involves  the  treatment  of  a  person  in  a  less favourable way than another person is, has been, or would be treated in a comparable situation on any of the nine grounds. [which exists, existed, may exist in the future, or is imputed to the person concerned].  Discrimination  by  imputation  is  also  prohibited.  This  feature  of  discrimination  law reflects  the  fact  that  people  are often  subjected to negative treatment because membership of a group  is  inaccurately  attributed  to  them.  For  example,  a  person  who  is  discriminated  against because  their  employer  incorrectly  assumes  that  they  are  trans  could  refer  a  complaint  of  less favourable  treatment  on  the  gender  ground,  even  though  in  fact  they  identity  with  the  gender assigned to them at birth.

Irish  discrimination  law  also  prohibits  harassment,  which  is  defined  as  any  form  of  unwanted conduct related to any of the discriminatory grounds which has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment  for  the  person.  Unwanted  conduct  could  take  the  form  of  acts,  requests,  spoken words, gestures or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material. This  aspect  of  the  law  aims  to  uphold  the  dignity  of  trans  people  and  requires  the  University community  to  proactively  ensure  that  offensive  language  and  behaviour  is  eliminated  /  not tolerated.

Some indicative examples of unlawful discrimination because of a person's gender identity or gender expression include:

-  Refusing employment, education, services or support;
-  Refusing to support a student;
-  Making offensive comments about a person's gender identity or gender expression;
-  Verbally or physically threatening someone or spreading malicious gossip;
-  Refusing to address a person by their correct gender pronoun or new name; and

-  Revealing the gender identity of a person to others without their explicit consent, either by disclosing information to individuals or groups - in other words, 'outing' someone.

The  Gender  Recognition  Act  2015  provides  a  process  enabling  people  to  achieve  full  legal recognition of their gender, and allows for the acquisition of a new birth certificate that reflects this change.

The Public Sector Duty was introduced under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014. It places an obligation on public sector bodies, in the performance of its functions, to have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment of its staff and the persons to whom it provides services, and to protect the human rights of its members, staff and the persons to whom it provides services.

This tool will also identify how policies are positively promoting equality, diversity and inclusion across the University.
