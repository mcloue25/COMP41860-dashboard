## STATUTE 11

## CHAPTER 1

1. The University, to further its objects and development, in accordance with the Universities Act, 1997 and its statutes, is empowered to collaborate with educational, business, professional, trade union, Irish language, cultural, artistic community and other interests, both inside and outside the State.
2. Where an institution, engaged in higher education, professional training and/or research and scholarship is linked to or associated with the University, and the linked or associated institution offers, either alone or in collaboration with the University, education and/or training programmes validated and accredited by the University, leading to the award of degrees or other qualifications by the University, it is necessary to formally recognise the linked or associated institution within the academic structures of the University.
3. The Governing Authority may, on the recommendation of the President, following consultation with Academic Council, designate an institution which fulfils the conditions of this statute as a Recognised College or Recognised Institute of the University. An institution may be designated a Recognised College or Institute only where there is a formal strategic link or association between the university and the institution, where the institution is engaged in higher education, professional training and/or research and scholarship, and the institution offers or proposes to offer, either alone or in collaboration with the University, education and/or training programmes validated and accredited by the University, leading to the award of degrees or other qualifications by the University.
4. The Governing Authority will designate an institution as a Recognised College or Institute only where it is satisfied as to the general character and financial sustainability of the institution, the numbers and qualifications of its teaching and academic staff, the standard of its teaching and the adequacy of the resources available to support student learning.
5. Where an institution seeks designation as a Recognised College or Institute of the University, the President will establish such processes as are necessary to review the nature and quality of the education, training, research, scholarly and other activities of the institution, to satisfy the University that the institution fulfils the requirements of this statute, and to establish the benefits to the University of establishing a formal linkage with the institution.
6. A Recognised College or Recognised Institute is distinct from a constituent College or constituent Institute of the University established in accordance with Statute 6 of the University.  The University and the Recognised College or Institute remain separate and distinct corporate entities, and the Board of the Recognised College or Institute retains responsibilities for the corporate governance, strategy, financial and administrative affairs of the Recognised College or Institute. The University does not assume any corporate, legal or fiduciary responsibility for the affairs of the Recognised College or Institute.  The designation of an institution as a Recognised College or Institute provides for an academic relationship between the University and the Recognised College or Institute and a structure for collaboration in academic and related activities and services.

7. The University will designate an institution as a Recognised College or Institute only where there is a written agreement between the University and the Recognised College or Institute which outlines the nature and objectives of the Recognised College or Institute and the nature and objectives of the relationship between the University and the Recognised College or Institute, provides for the governance and management of the relationship, describes the range of activities to be undertaken by the Recognised College or Institute, and describes the arrangements for validation and accreditation of educational programmes, oversight of academic standards and awards, and quality assurance and enhancement.
8. The written agreement between the University and the Recognised College or Institute will also specify the duration of the academic relationship, procedures for review and continuation (or termination) of the relationship, including provision for early termination of the relationship if there are grave concerns about the quality or nature of the activities of a Recognised College or Institute, and procedures for the resolution of disputes.
9. The University will normally use the designation Recognised College in preference to Recognised Institute to refer to a linked or associated higher education or professional training institution; the designation Recognised Institute will normally be reserved for linked or associated institutions primarily dedicated to research and scholarship and the education and training of students for research degrees and qualifications.
10. The designation of an institution as a Recognised College or Institute will provide for the validation, accreditation, quality assurance and quality enhancement of educational programmes, delivered by the Recognised College or Institute alone or in collaboration with the university or other higher education or professional institutions, which lead to degrees or other qualifications of the University, and will provide for the award and conferral of degrees and other qualifications of the University on those who have successfully completed such programmes and satisfied the requirements for the award. The University, through its Academic Council, is responsible for ensuring that the quality and standards of educational programmes, academic activities, teaching and student learning within the Recognised College or Institute are appropriate in general, and in particular where such programmes and activities lead to the award of degrees and qualifications of the University.
11. The designation of an institution as a Recognised College or Institute may also provide for the following:
- a. collaboration in teaching and learning, education and training both academic and professional, including joint programmes of education, training and research;
- b. collaboration in research and scholarship, including joint programmes;
- c. student mobility between the University and the Recognised College or Institute, including access by students of the University to modules and courses in the Recognised College or Institute and vice versa;
- d. joint supervision of research students;
- e. joint academic appointments, either as cross-appointment (formal appointment to one institution with adjunct or visiting status at the other) or formal joint appointments;
- f. staff mobility and secondment between the University and the Recognised College or Institute;
- g. collaboration in other academic and related activities including but not limited to

- i. advisory and consultancy services;
- ii. conferences and events;
- iii. international programmes or alliances;
- iv. public or community engagement activities;
- v. publication and dissemination
- h. the sharing of facilities, support services and functions;
- i. joint collaboration with educational, business, professional, trade union, Irish language, cultural, artistic community and other interests, both inside and outside the State;
- j. other such activities as the Recognised College or Institute, with the agreement of the Governing Authority of the University, may determine will further the objects and development of the University and the Recognised College or Institute.

The extent to which any or all of the above apply will be described in the agreement between the University and the Recognised College or Institute.

12. The designation of an institution as a Recognised College or Institute does not preclude the Recognised College or Institute engaging in education, training or other activities which do not lead to degrees or qualifications of the University, although the Academic Council and Governing Authority must be satisfied that the quality of any such activities are appropriate to a Recognised College or Institute. The Recognised College or Institute will not seek to have academic programmes validated by another higher education institution or agency, or have degrees or other qualifications conferred on its students by another higher education institution or agency, without the prior agreement of the Governing Authority of the University, except in the case of certificates and qualifications awarded by professional bodies and organisations, where Recognised Colleges or Institutes may freely enter into arrangements with such bodies to provide education and training leading to such certificates and qualifications, provided the Academic Council and Governing Authority remain satisfied that the quality of any such education and training is appropriate to a Recognised College or Institute.
13. The Academic Council of the University, under the terms of the agreement between the University and the Recognised College or Institute and subject to the provisions of the Universities Act, 1997 and other relevant legislation, shall establish procedures for the validation and accreditation of academic programmes and for quality assurance and quality enhancement.
14. The Academic Council of the University shall establish such and so many Programme Boards, Boards of Studies, Examination Boards or other academic committees as it deems necessary to perform the following functions, in accordance with procedures established by and subject to review by Academic Council:
- a. validation and accreditation of academic programmes;
- b. overseeing the curriculum, teaching and learning and academic standards of academic and educational programmes leading to degrees and qualifications of the University;
- c. overseeing academic and educational standards and quality generally within the Recognised College or Institute;

- d. encouraging excellence in research and scholarship within the Recognised College or Institute;
- e. overseeing the selection, admission, retention and exclusion of students;
- f. determining the results of examinations and recommending to the University the award of degrees and qualifications;
- g. awarding scholarships and prizes;
- h. overseeing quality assurance and quality enhancement generally within the Recognised College or Institute.
15. The Programme Boards, Boards of Studies, Examination Boards or other academic committees as may be established by the Academic Council of the University may include as members such persons from within or outside the University and the Recognised College or Institute as may be required to provide the expertise to perform the functions as outlined in Section 14 above and to provide for good academic governance.  The level of representation for the Recognised College or Institute on such boards and committees will be provided for in a written agreement between the University and the relevant Recognised College or Institute.
16. The examinations and assessments for programmes leading to degrees and qualifications of the University, and the award and conferral of degrees and qualifications of the University, shall be conducted in accordance with the statutes of the University.  The Recognised College or Institute shall establish regulations and manage procedures for examination and assessment of students of the Recognised College or Institute, such procedures being subject to the prior approval of the Academic Council of the University and aligned with the procedures of the University.
17. The Recognised College or Institute shall establish and manage procedures to determine appeals by students of the Recognised College or Institute in relation to the results of examinations and assessments, such procedures being subject to the prior approval of the Academic Council of the University and aligned with the procedures of the University.
18. The Recognised College or Institute shall establish and manage procedures to regulate the discipline of students of the Recognised College or Institute, such procedures being subject to the prior approval of the Academic Council of the University.
19. Students enrolled to programmes within the Recognised College or Institute are students of the Recognised College or Institute in the first instance, though they may be accorded privileges within the University as affiliated students.  Students enrolled to programmes which are formally established as joint programmes between the University and the Recognised College or Institute may be registered both in the University and the Recognised College or Institute; such students shall be subject to the regulations and procedures of the University or of the Recognised College or Institute in relation to all academic matters including examination and assessment, the award and conferral of degrees and qualifications, appeals in relation to the results of examinations and assessments and discipline. The written agreement between the University and the Recognised College or Institute will provide for the assignment of responsibility for the maintenance of the student record and the return of student numbers to the Higher Education Authority or other agencies on a programme by programme basis either to the Recognised College or Institute or to the University.
20. The agreement between the University and a Recognised College or Institute, subject to the Charter and Statutes of the University and to the Universities Act, 1997 and any other

- relevant legislation and to the approval of the Governing Authority of the University, may provide that the Governing Authority appoint, as members of the Governing Authority, individuals nominated by the Recognised College or Institute.
21. The agreement between the University and a Recognised College or Institute, subject to the Charter and Statutes of the University and to the Universities Act, 1997 and any other relevant legislation and to the approval of the Academic Council of the University, may provide for the co-option by Academic Council and sub-committees of the Academic Council of individuals nominated by the Recognised College or Institute.
22. Except where specifically referenced in this Statute, the provisions of the Statutes of the University, do not apply to Recognised Colleges or Institutes or to the employees of Recognised Colleges or Institutes.
