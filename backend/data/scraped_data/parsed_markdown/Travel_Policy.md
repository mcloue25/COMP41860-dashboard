## 1. Environmental responsibility

For  obvious environmental reasons, we encourage staff to consider alternatives to travel, particularly air travel and to be aware of the following facilities available to all staff which can be used as an alternative to travel:

- Google Hangout
- Skype
- Zoom

Instructions on how to use Hangout and Skype

Room booking

## 2. Purpose of Policy

- 2.1 This  policy  sets  out  the  protocols  and  procedures  to  be  followed  by  staff  when travelling  on  university  business,  including  financial,  environmental  and  safety considerations.
- 2.2 The travel policy has been framed having regard to the following:
- (a) the efficient conduct of university business;
- (b) the circulars issued by the Department of Finance relating to travel, mileage and subsistence rates;
- (c) Revenue  requirements  in  relation  to  expenses  paid  to  employees.    Only expenses  which  are  'wholly,  exclusively  and  necessarily'  incurred  in  the performance of a staff  member's  duties may  be  reimbursed on  a  tax -free basis;
- (d) the effect of our travel decisions on the environment.  This revised Travel Po licy represents a first step on the path to rapidly reducing UCD's transport emissions. The Policy will be revisited on an annual basis, with each revision representing a progression beyond the current policy and reflecting UCD's highest possible ambition in reducing our carbon footprint via travel; and
- (e)         the international travel approval process and the notifications required to be made to the UCD Safety, Insurance, Operational Risk and Compliance Office (SIRC) in advance of international travel.  The policy also provides details of the University's travel insurance cover in place for employees and postgraduate students engaged in approved international travel.

## 3. Scope of Policy

- 3.1 The travel policy applies to all travel undertaken on university business regardless of the budget from which travel is funded (school/unit non-pay budget, research grant or other funds).
- 3.2 More  restricted  rules  may  apply  to  expenditure  chargeable  to  research  grants depending on the terms and conditions attaching to the particular research grant.  In

these situations, staff must ensure that all travel expenditure complies with the terms and conditions attaching to the particular research grant.

## 4. General Points in Relation to Staff Travelling on University Business

- 4.1 It is essential that all members of staff travelling on university business are familiar with this policy and with the correct procedures for claiming reimbursement of travel expenses.
- 4.2 Travel expenses should always be kept to a minimum and should represent value for money for the university at all times.  Each staff member is accountable to ensure that only valid, reasonable and necessary expenses are incurred and that all unnecessary expenditure and extravagance are avoided.
- 4.3 All  claims  for  reimbursement  of  travel  expenses  must  be  clearly  presented,  fully vouched and properly authorised.
- 4.4 All  travel  on  university  business  must  be  approved in advance by the  faculty/staff member's line manager. Additionally  the (SIRC) international travel safety approval process set out in Section 6.0 of this document applies.
- 4.5 The purpose of travel on university business must be clearly documented on the claim form.    Claims  for  reimbursement  of  travel  expenses  should  be  supported  by documentation  confirming  the  purpose  of  travel  (e.g.  conference  programmes, delegate lists, agendas for meetings, detailed itineraries, letters of invitation, etc).
- 4.6 For  staff,  the  costs  of  all  travel  on  university  business  must  be  fully  recorded  and reported.    Claims  for  reimbursement  of  travel  expenses  must  be  supported  by itemised  receipts  for  all  expenditure  claimed  (apart  from  mileage  and per  diem subsistence claims where standard civil service rates apply).
- 4.7              For non-staff members, reimbursement of all travel on university business can only be claimed  on  vouched  expenses  (not  subsistence  rates).    Mileage  expenses  can  be claimed in accordance with University and Revenue policies on mileage and subject to the prior approval of the relevant School/Unit.
- 4.8 No personal travel expenditure or other personal costs should be claimed from the university.
- 4.9 Where  staff  extend  their  trip  for  personal  reasons,  it  must  be  ensured  and demonstrated that all additional costs are borne personally by the staff member.  In such cases, staff must clearly demonstrate that legitimate university business is the primary purpose of travel.  Any extensions for personal reasons must be recorded in staff annual leave records.

- 4.10 It is university policy to pay all claims for reimbursement of travel expenses directly to the bank accounts of staff members.
- 4.11 While credit card statements provide proof of payment, the actual detailed invoice or purchase voucher related to the credit card purchase should always be attached to the claim form.
- 4.12 When  claiming  accommodation  costs,  the  invoice  and  proof  of  payment  for  the accommodation costs should be attached to the claim form rather than an online booking form.
- 4.13 The  expense  claim  forms  are  to  be  used  for  the  reimbursement  of  travel  and subsistence expenses, hospitality expenses and minor costs. Staff must not personally purchase large items of equipment  (e.g. P.C.s) and  other goods  and  claim reimbursement through the expense claim system -all  such  purchases  should  be made through the University's eProcurement purchasing system.

## 5. Authorisation of Claims for Reimbursement of Travel Expenses

- 5.1 All  claims  for  reimbursement  of  travel  expenses  must  be  authorised  by  the appropriate budget-holder (i.e. Head of School/Unit, Principal Investigator).  No staff member can authorise their own travel or expenses claims.
- 5.2 Where the budget-holder is the claimant,  the  claim for  reimbursement  should  be approved in accordance with the following authorisation schedule:
- 5.3 Staff authorising claims for reimbursement of travel expenses should be aware that, in  authorising  an  expense  claim,  they  are  confirming  that  the  expenses  are  valid, relate to university business and are reasonable in cost.  Where a staff member is not satisfied that an expenses claim should be authorised, the expenses claim should be referred back to the claimant for clarification or additional information.

## 6. Additional authorisation required for safety and travel insurance purposes

- 6.1 The approvals process is based on the Department of Foreign Affairs Travel Advisory System .
- o For  low-risk  travel  in  the  UK,  Switzerland,  the  EU  and  the  EEA  no  safety authorisation is required and travel insurance can be assumed. This does not apply to  travel  for  fieldwork  purposes  or  group  travel,  including  undergraduate  field trips, which must be submitted to SIRC in advance to confirm travel insurance.
- o Permission from your Head of School / Unit must be obtained for any travel to a country or region which is outside of the UK / Switzerland / EU / EEA, and details of such travel must be submitted to SIRC in advance to confirm travel insurance.
- o Permission from your UMT line manager and your Head of School / Unit must be obtained for any travel to a country or region which is subject to a Department of Foreign Affairs'  'Avoid  Non  Essential Travel'  travel  advisory,  and  details  of  such travel must be submitted to SIRC in advance to confirm travel insurance.
- o Any travel that requires approval must also be risk assessed using the International Travel Risk Assessment template.
- o For travel involving fieldwork a Fieldwork Risk Assessment must also be completed irrespective of the location.
- o Authorisation is required for certain types of travel, as per table 1 overleaf.

## 6.2 Notification to SIRC Office

When making a submission to the SIRC Office seeking confirmation of travel cover the following details must be included:

- o Full travel itinerary to include dates of travel and purpose of travel.
- o International Travel Risk assessment if applicable.
- o Fieldwork Risk assessment if applicable.

Submissions should be made to the SIRC Office at least ten days in advance of any travel.

## 6.3 Covid 19 Considerations

Persons engaged in international travel may also need to consider the following:

- o Will they be required to provide proof of vaccination before they travel?
- o Will they be required to take a Covid 19 test before travel or upon arrival in the country?
- o Will they be required to selfisolate or 'quarantine' for a period of time in their destination country, and if so, have they made arrangements to do so and be supported whilst doing so?
- o Will they be required to restrict their movements upon their return to Ireland, and if so have they made arrangements to do so and be supported whilst doing so? In addition, have they agreed any such absence from the workplace with their Head of Unit / School in advance of their travel?

## 6.4 Travel Advisories

Before travelling abroad individuals should familiarise themselves with the current situation in the country / region of destination. This is especially important given the dynamic situation with respect to Covid 19 but is also relevant for other travel safety issues. Up to date travel advice is available from the Department of Foreign Affairs website.

## 7. Travel and Personal Accident Insurance

- 7.1 International travel must be notified to the SIRC Office, as outlined in section 6.0 of this document in order to confirm that travel and personal accident insurance is in place.

When applied this insurance cover extends to travel that originates in Ireland and from the  time  that  an  insured  person  leaves  their  home  or  their  normal  place  of  work (whichever is the latest) and ends when that person returns to their normal place of work or their home (whichever is the earliest). If personal travel is undertaken either before or after an approved travel activity then the cover will begin at the start of the day of the official business and cease at the end of day on the last day of business, whichever is relevant.

There  are  limitations  to  the  extent  of  cover  provided  under  the  UCD  Travel  and Personal Accident Insurance Policy, including;

- o Restrictions  under  the  Personal  Accident  section  of  the  policy,  which  primarily provides for emergency medical treatment such that the individual will be fit to travel home again.
- o The duration of travel is limited to 12 months for any single trip, however any travel of longer than 90 days must be notified to SIRC irrespective of destination so cover can be confirmed.
- o Persons who are habitually resident outside of Ireland / resident outside of Ireland for more than 12 months are not covered by the provisions of the UCD Travel and Personal Accident Policy
- o Travel which begins outside of Ireland and is not part of a continuing trip may not be insured -contact sirc@ucd.ie for more details.
- o Restrictions in policy coverage apply to persons over the age of 75 years -contact sirc@ucd.ie for more details.
- o Persons with pre-existing illnesses or medical conditions should not travel against the advice of their medical practitioner. To do so may invalidate cover under the policy.

Further information on the cover provided under UCD's Travel and Personal Accident Policy can be found in the UCD Travel Insurance Guide for Staff  and the UCD Travel Insurance Guide for Postgrads.

As part of the confirmation of insurance cover the SIRC Office will provide travellers with details of the limits of cover in place and emergency contact numbers to be used for medical emergencies whilst abroad.

Notwithstanding the extension of UCD's insurance cover all persons travelling within Switzerland, the UK, the EU and the EEA are advised to obtain a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). This allows access to the public health systems of countries within these areas and is free of charge.

It should be noted that in certain circumstances cover for losses related to Covid 19, such  as cancellation, curtailment, self-isolation,  mandatory  Covid  19  tests  or quarantine  costs  on  arrival  etc.  will  be  limited  and  may  not  be  recoverable  from insurers.

In the event that the Covid 19 situation in the country of travel deteriorates further or the travel advisory status changes, such that return travel is impacted, insurance cover may be affected.

- 7.2 The costs of any additional travel insurance policies taken out by staff members will not be reimbursed by the University.

## 8.   Visa and Passport Costs

- 8.1 The University will reimburse the cost of entry visas required for travel on university business.
- 8.2 The cost of passports/passport renewal will not be reimbursed.

## 9. Air Travel

Staff should always be aware that flying is a uniquely high-impact activity for a consumer which increases their carbon footprint.  Therefore, all alternative options should be considered before booking a flight.  S hould air travel still be deemed essential, then the following rules apply:

- 9.1 (a) All air travel should be on economy class flights.
- (b)  Online  approval  (shortly  to  be  introduced)  should  be  in  accordance  with  the following authorisation schedule:
- 9.2 Economy is our class of transport.  In exceptional circumstances, business class travel can  be  permitted.    Unless  there  are  exceptional  circumstances,  requests  to  travel business class should not be submitted for consideration unless the criteria detailed in points (a) -(c) below are met.
- (a) Flight time exceeds eight hours;
- (b) Meetings/Events/Classes are scheduled close to arrival time;
- (c) The additional costs of business class travel can be met from existing budgetary provision -and  will  not  be  from  an  exchequer  source  except  for  exceptional circumstances approved by the Bursar;
- (d) All  Business  Class  Travel  requires  online  College  Principal  or  VP  approval  plus Bursar approval.  Applications for approval of business class travel submitted must

|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| President                                               | Chair of the Governing Authority                      |

provide a clear justification for the use of business class travel in each case and detail the cost of an equivalent economy class flight;

- (e) First class air travel will not be approved in any circumstances.
- 9.3 When bookings are made through a travel agency, they should be made through the Office of Government Procurement's (OGP's) appointed travel agency, currently Club Travel.  Further details of this contract are available on the UCD Procurement Office website.
- 9.4 It is recognised that, for some bookings, it may be possible to book low-cost internet fares directly with airlines.  In these instances, staff members may book flights directly with the airline and claim reimbursement through the staff expenses system.  When claiming reimbursement for internet bookings, a copy of the electronic ticket and proof of payment must be attached to the expenses claim form.
- 9.5 Every effort should always be made to procure the cheapest possible ticket.  Travel should be planned as far in advance as possible to take advantage of discounted air tickets, sale fares, etc.
- 9.6 The availability of frequent traveller points should not influence the choice of airline and any such points obtained on university flights should be used against the cost of future flights undertaken on university business.

## 10.  Public Transport

- 10.1 Travel by public transport (rail, bus, taxi) will be reimbursed where supported by a valid receipt / travel ticket.  Staff attending meetings in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Belfast and other locations within Ireland should, where possible, travel by bus/train with a view to keeping travel and mileage costs to a minimum.
- 10.2 Taxis should only be used when strictly required and the relevant claim form should always detail the journey involved and the reason for use/event involved.

## 11. Car Rental

- 11.1 Car rental should only be undertaken when it represents the best value for money for the university in respect of the trip in question.  The model selected should be the most economical bearing in mind the number of staff to be transported, and the rental period should always be kept to a minimum. Care should be taken to ensure adequate motor insurance is in place. UCD does not extend motor insurance to hired vehicles.

## 12. Mileage

- 12.1 Staff  using  their  private  car  on  university  business  may  claim  mileage  at  the appropriate civil service mileage rate.  The current mileage rates for cars and bicycles are available on the Finance Office website.
- 12.2 Staff  using  their  private  car  on  university  business  must  ensure  that  their  private motor insurance policy covers business usage and are required to confirm that such insurance cover is in place when submitting a claim for mileage.
- 12.3 The following points should be noted in relation to mileage expenses:
- (a) Staff should only use their private car on university business where no suitable public transport is available;
- (b) The mileage rate covers all expenses associated with the use of a staff member's private car on university business (e.g. fuel, motor tax, insurance, maintenance, etc.);
- (c) External car parking charges and tolls will be reimbursed where supported by the necessary receipts;
- (d) No reimbursement will be made for parking fines or clamping fees;
- (e) Mileage cannot be claimed in respect of any portion of a journey which covers all or part of the claimant's usual route between home and normal place of work;
- (f) Where a staff member travels to a location direct from home or returns home direct, the mileage payable will be calculated by reference to the distance from home or normal place of work, whichever is the lesser;
- (g) All claims for mileage must be supported with full details of all journeys taken including the departure point, the destination, the finishing point, the purpose of the journey, and the number of kilometres travelled;
- (h) The University does not reimburse the cost of UCD campus parking permits.

## 13. Subsistence

- 13.1 It is preferable that expenses should be claimed by reference to vouched costs but, where applicable, Department of Finance rates may be used as a basis to recover subsistence costs (accommodation and meals).  A full listing of current subsistence rates is available on the Finance Office website.
- 13.2 When claiming expenses based on subsistence rates, the following should be noted:
- Subsistence should only be claimed up to the level of actual expenditure incurred. No element  of  profit/excess  over  the  actual  amount  of  expenses  incurred  should  be claimed.

- Prior to travel, staff members should review whether subsistence rates are available for their intended location.  Where no subsistence rate is listed by the Department of Finance for a particular location, the claim must be based on actual vouched costs. Claims should not be submitted based on subsistence rates for the nearest city or location for which a subsistence rate is available.  In some cases, the subsistence rate available will be a combination of vouched accommodation costs plus a flat-rate meal allowance.
- It is important to note that subsistence rates are the maximum rates which can be claimed for a location and, if the actual costs incurred are lower than the maximum rate, the lower figure should be claimed.
- Care should be taken to ensure that no double claiming of subsistence takes place i.e. if  hotel  bills  include  the  cost of breakfast or if conference fees include the cost of lunches/dinners, the rate of subsistence claimed should be reduced accordingly.
- Subsistence should not be claimed for flight times and should only be claimed from time of arrival in a destination to time of departure.
- The calculation basis for any subsistence claimed should be clearly detailed on the claim form.
- Subsistence rates reduce after one month to 75% of the listed rates for months two and three, and to 50% for months four to six.  Special arrangements are in place for staff undertaking long-term sabbaticals/research leave and these should be separately confirmed in advance with the Finance Office.
- In cases where a 24-hour subsistence rate is available and a claimant submits a claim based on vouched accommodation expenses plus a daily subsistence rate for meals, the claim should not exceed the 24-hour subsistence rate available for the location. The 24-hour rate should be taken as the maximum amount which can be claimed on a per diem basis subject to the exception below.
- It is recognised that, on occasion (e.g. where there may be a requirement to stay in a particular hotel for business reasons), the 24-hour rate available may not be sufficient to cover the actual hotel and meal costs and, in such cases, a written statement from the Head of School/Unit confirming that the cost represented the best possible value for money must be provided.

## 14. Accommodation

- 14.1 Accommodation should be comfortable and safe with essential amenities and should always represent value for money for the university.  As a general rule, staff should not stay in 5-star or luxury hotels and standard rooms rather than superior rooms should be booked.  Suites or mini-suites should never be booked.

## 15. Time Limit on Claims

- 15.1 All  claims  for  reimbursement  of  travel  expenses  should  be  submitted  as  soon  as possible following completion of travel and must be claimed within twelve months.

For research grants, the claim must also be submitted within twelve months. Where the research project has an end date prior to the twelve month limit, the claims should be  submitted  before  the  end  date  of  the  project.    If  in  doubt,  please  contact  the Research Finance Office for advice.

## 16. Advances

- 16.1 Staff  may  request  a  travel  expenses  advance  by  completing  and  submitting  an Advance Form.   In requesting an advance, the proposed travel dates and expected costs to be incurred should be detailed on the form.  The amount payable is limited to 75% of the expected costs of the trip.  When submitting an advance claim, there is no  need  to  submit  additional  evidence  or  vouched  receipts,  but  a  fully  vouched settlement claim must be submitted within two weeks of completion of travel.
- 16.2 Staff advances are closely monitored and should be kept to a minimum at all times. Requests  for  advances  should  reflect  the  likely  level  of  expenditure  which  will  be incurred  within  the  short-term  rather  than  providing  a  long-term  float  for  a  staff member.
- 16.3 Advances will normally be issued up to two months before a trip but requests for longer term advances will be considered in some cases.  On occasion, it may be more appropriate  to  make  a  number  of  smaller  advance  claims  rather  than  one  claim covering a long period.
- 16.4 In cases where an advance is issued but the planned trip does not take place, the funds should immediately be returned to the Finance Office.
- 16.5 Expenses claims will not be processed for payment where a staff member has an outstanding advance in place.
- 16.6 E-mail reminders will be sent each month to staff who have advances outstanding past the settlement date and no further expenses will be paid until such advances are cleared.
- 16.7 The Finance, Remuneration and Asset Management Committee has confirmed that unsettled advances can be recovered as a deduction through the university payroll.  It is expected that this measure will be used as a last resort and that all advances will be settled on a timely basis.

## 17. Submission of a False or Exaggerated Claim

- 17.1 The submission of a false or exaggerated expenses claim is a serious matter which may lead to disciplinary action being taken by the university.

- 17.2 The university auditors, under the Criminal Justice (Theft &amp; Fraud Offences) Act, 2001, are required to inform An Garda Siochána of any cases of fraud, irrespective of value, which come to their attention.

## 18. Freedom of Information

- 18.1 Details  of  expenses  payments  to  university  staff  may  be  released  in  response  to requests received under Freedom of Information legislation.
