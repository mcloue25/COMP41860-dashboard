Policy owner: UCD HR

Approval date and body: 10 June 2025, UMT

## 1. Purpose

This policy deals with the UCD Conference Allowance. The purpose of the conference allowance is to allow employees, in consultation with their Head of School/Unit, to attend relevant conferences or other training or development events. These should be linked to the employee's professional development and assist in building sustainable networks in the interests of the University.

## 2. Scope

The following categories of staff are entitled to claim a conference allowance:

1. Faculty from Lecturer/Assistant Professor to Full Professor.
2. Staff of Grade A02 or equivalent and above.
3. Technical Officers and above.
4. IT staff Programmer II and above.
5. Part-time or temporary employees at the levels above, are entitled to claim conference allowance on a pro-rata basis.
6. Employees who commence employment during a two-year conference allowance period will be entitled to an allowance based on a pro-rata basis. For those to whom the conference allowance policy applies, it is considered to be a term and condition of employment.
7. Funded employees are not entitled to claim the conference allowance but may be awarded an equivalent allowance from the research grant, subject to terms of the particular grant and its budget provisions.
8. Employees already in receipt of an allowance for development purposes, as part of their employment contract, are not entitled to claim the conference allowance e.g. Continuing Medical Education Allowance.

## 3. Principles

- 3.1 The conference allowance is currently €1,400 over a two-year period.
- 3.2 The two-year period commences only in a year where the date is an 'even year'.
- 3.3 In that year it is from the 1st October example below:
- 1st October 2018 to 30th September 2020
- 1st October 2020 to 30th September 2022 etc.
- 3.4 The conference allowance may be spent on academic and professional conferences (attendance or presentation of paper), symposia, attendance at training courses (for relevant skills and knowledge enhancement) or other training or development events relevant to the employee's role.
- 3.5 The use of the conference allowance should be made in consultation with the employee's Head of School/Unit.

- 3.6 Leave with pay to attend the conference, training programme or development initiative, is subject to approval of the Head of School/Unit and the operational requirements at the time.
- 3.7 Unspent balances may not be carried over from one two-year period to the next.
- 3.8 Payments from the conference allowance may only be claimed through the travel &amp; expenses system, Bursar's Office. Payments can only be issued to the holder of the conference allowance rather than to any creditor or third party. The allowance is charged to the employee's own school/unit.
- 3.9 The conference allowance may only be claimed in respect of conferences/events within the two-year period i.e. the 2024-2026 Conference Allowance cannot be used to cover the cost of an event held after September 2026 or before October 2024, and likewise for with two-year periods.
