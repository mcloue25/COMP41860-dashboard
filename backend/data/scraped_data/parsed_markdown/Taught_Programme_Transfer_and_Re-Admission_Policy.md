UPB 16 February 2023

ACEC 1 March 2023

## 1  Purpose

The objective of the policy is to support and maximise progression, widen participation and retention, allowing as much flexibility as possible to ensure students are in programmes that suit their academic strengths and offer them the best prospect of achieving their full potential.

The University provides a number of mechanisms whereby current or former UCD students may apply to transfer to a new programme of study, re-enter a programme previously started but not completed, and prospective students may apply to enter into a UCD programme having undertaken learning at another Higher Education Institution.

## 2  Definitions

Internal Transfer : an applicant who is currently a UCD student 1 , or has previously attended but not completed, and is seeking to move to a different programme at the same NFQ level.

External Transfer : an applicant who is currently attending, or has previously attended but not completed, a programme in a Higher Education Institution (HEI) other than UCD and is seeking to gain entry to a similar or different programme in UCD at the same NFQ level.

Progression Applicant : an applicant who is seeking to enter on the basis of a completed recognised NFQ level 5, 6 or 7 qualification (normally QQI-FET or HETAC and certain linked UCD programmes).

Re-Admission Applicant : A former UCD student who did not complete an award 2  and who is seeking to return to the same programme in UCD. Applicants whose registration to a programme has previously been discontinued or terminated will also have their application considered under the relevant UCD policy.

Programme : This is the course of study, for example, BA Degree. Each programme will have a set number of stages and credits that you need to complete to get a University award (degree, diploma or certificate).

Stage : A student will progress through an undergraduate programme in stages. An undergraduate stage is normally completed when a student successfully accumulates 60 credits. For full-time undergraduate students, a 60-credit stage will normally be completed in one academic year.

EU/Non-EU: Status as an EU or non-EU applicant is defined based on the fees criteria.

## 3  Scope

This document details the University's transfer policy for managing and processing programme transfer/re-admission requests and applies to:

Undergraduate EU applicants (see sections 5)

Undergraduate non-EU applicants (see sections 6)

1 including those on official Leave of Absence

2  A student who has obtained an exit award at the same NFQ level as their original programme of registration cannot be readmitted to their original programme.

Graduate Taught applicants (see section 7).

## 4  Principles

## 4.1  General Principles - all applicants

- All applications for transfer/re-admission are subject to availability of places and adherence to this policy.
- Current UCD students must remain fully registered to their original programme of study until a programme transfer is approved and fully processed.
- With the exception of UCD recognised progression routes, undergraduate transfers will only be considered from NFQ Level 8 programmes.
- Applicants are responsible for initiating transfer/re-admission requests and should seek information about possible options before making applications.
- Applicants must meet the academic requirements for the stage they wish to enter (e.g. any prerequisites, co-requisites or accepted equivalences). The Governing Board shall determine the academic requirements to be met by the applicant.
- Applicants whose registration to a programme has previously been discontinued or terminated will also have their application considered under the relevant UCD policy.
- The policy shall uphold the University's strategic commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, to ensure that it will not negatively impact an individual as a result of their membership of a group, represented under UCD's equality grounds.
- For a UCD degree to be awarded, at least half the overall programme credits must normally have been earned in UCD.
- Transfer may have a direct impact on tuition-related fees and charges. Students will be expected to pay fees on a pro-rata basis with fee exemptions offered for modules that have been transferred. Students who qualify for "free fees" may be required to pay University fees for a period equivalent to previous attendance (see www.ucd.ie/fees).
- A student who accepts an offer of another programme ceases to be a student of the original programme. Internal transfers who change their mind about the new acceptance within the first three weeks of the trimester may be permitted to change back to the original programme, subject to availability of places and with the agreement of Admissions and all relevant Governing Boards 3 .
- In line with the Admissions Policy, offers for taught programmes will not be made after the third week of a trimester.
- A number of programmes place restrictions on applications and will not normally consider
- o applications from those who have been unsuccessful (i.e. failed to meet programme requirements) in similar programmes in UCD or at another HEI, or
- o applicants with issues that may affect their ability to register with a relevant professional body such as the Irish Medical Council and Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.

In exceptional circumstances Governing Boards may decide to consider such applications. Applicants may present their case in writing to the Director of Admissions. A list of programmes applying restrictions on transfer applicants is published on the restrictions page at www.ucd.ie/transfer.

Students who are admitted will be bound by the UCD Academic Regulations. In some cases, students may wish to apply for Recognition of Prior Learning in addition to that granted by the transfer process (see Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) policy)

3 Please note that this does not apply to start of term transfers detailed in Section 5.2 due to the timing of offers.

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

## 5  EU Undergraduate Transfer/Re-Admission applications

- Details of application procedure and closing dates are available at www.ucd.ie/transfer.
- As applications are assessed as soon as possible after the closing date, applicants awaiting results of later examinations will only be considered if they are received in sufficient time to make offers within three weeks of the start of trimester AND places remain following initial offers.
- Deferral or Leave of Absence is not permissible for the trimester following acceptance of a transfer/re-admission offer.
- At the discretion of the Governing Board, an applicant may use a successfully completed university examination to meet certain subject entry requirements (e.g. Stage 1 Mathematics as a substitution for a school-leaving Mathematics requirement). If an applicant wishes to meet requirements in this way, they must initiate this request with UCD Registry - Admissions.

## 5.1  Transfer/Re-admission to commence Stage 1

This section applies to those who wish to enter Stage 1, Trimester 1 of a programme 4  of study in UCD.

The programme transfer application is made via CAO while the transfer of modules and credits is managed by UCD Registry on the recommendation of the Governing Board (see RPL policy). These involve two separate application procedures.

Applications are made via CAO and, will be assessed 5  in competition with other applicants on the basis of their school-leaving examinations or meeting the requirements of relevant access routes such as Mature Years. Applicants must declare previous third level attendance on the CAO form regardless of whether examinations were completed or not. Failure to declare a previous third level attendance could result in an application being invalidated.

## 5.2  Transfer at the start of Stage 1 (Internal Applicants Only)

This section applies to students who have accepted a UCD offer via CAO and are registered to Stage 1 of that UCD programme in the current year. This transfer opportunity will only be available where there is adequate time 6  after the last CAO reply date to allow for the offer to issue before third week of a 12-week trimester has elapsed (in line with UCD Admissions Policy).

Students may apply for transfer to Stage 1 of another UCD programme, if places remain in that programme following the close of the CAO offer season in the current year and if timing of CAO offers allows. Applicants who entered via an accepted alternative entry route (e.g. mature years, HEAR, DARE, QQI-FET) can be considered if places remain in that category's quota.

Students must meet the full entry requirements of the target programme, including current years points required for entry, subject requirements and any additional tests or entry criteria.

Where the number of eligible applicants exceeds the number of places available, applicants will be ranked on their points and random selection will apply where appropriate.

As there will be a very short timeframe in which to accept an offer, the onus is on the applicant to ensure they have adequately researched their choice. Once the offer is accepted, it will not be possible to return to the previous programme.

4 Students must not apply for the programme for which they are currently registered and will be deemed ineligible if they do so. If they wish to repeat the year in the same programme, they should contact their College Office.

5 unless the restriction in 4.2 or those in General Principles apply,

6 Minimum three working days i.e. at least one working day is required to process applications and issue offers and further 2 working days are required to allow applicants adequate time to decide on the offer.

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

## 5.3  Transfer/Re-admission during a Stage

This section applies to students who wish to apply to the Spring Trimester of a Stage and is subject to the following conditions:

There must be places available in the new programme. In general, all programmes are full at the start of term and vacancies will only arise if students withdraw or fail to progress. An indicative list of available places is published at www.ucd.ie/transfer.

Applicants must meet the minimum entry requirements of the programme or meet the requirements for admission via an accepted alternative entry pathway (e.g. Mature or QQI-FET).

## For entry to Stage 1:

Applicants must have the current years points 7   required for entry to the target programme 8

and

Have passed a minimum of 20 ECTS credits, including sufficient modules and grades relevant to the new programme they are seeking to enter 9 . For the application to be successful it must be possible for the student to progress to stage 2 at the end of the academic year (in accordance with section 5 of the Academic Regulations).

## For entry to stage 2 or later:

Applicants must have passed at least 60 ECTS credits 10  for each previous stage, in addition to 20 ECTS credits for the autumn trimester of the stage they are seeking to enter, including sufficient modules and grades relevant to the new programme 5 . External applicants must have a minimum points standard from their school-leaving examinations (see Appendix A). If applicants entered via an accepted alternative entry pathway, they must meet the requirements via that route (see Appendix A).

For the application to be successful it must be possible for the student to progress to the next stage at the end of the academic year (in accordance with section 5 of the Academic Regulations).

Where the number of eligible applicants exceeds the number of places available, the relevant Governing Board will make decisions based primarily on both the compatibility of the modules completed and the student's academic performance in their previous third level studies. Where required, the assessment may also include a personal statement, school-leaving examination results or other relevant entry criteria.

## 5.4  Transfer/Re-admission to commence Stage 2 or a later stage

This section applies to students who wish to apply to commence Stage 2 or a later stage, in the Autumn Trimester of a different programme and is subject to the following conditions:

If the student is permitted to transfer, it should be possible for them to progress to the next stage at the end of the academic year (in accordance with section 5 of the Academic Regulations).

Where the number of eligible applicants exceeds the number of places available, the relevant Governing Board will make decisions based primarily on the compatibility of the modules completed and the student's academic performance in their previous third level; the assessment may also include a personal statement, school-leaving examination results or other relevant entry criteria.

Applicants who do not have sufficient relevant credits for Stage 2 admission should apply via CAO for Stage 1 and, on admission, seek Recognition of Prior Learning.

## 5.5  Progression Routes
