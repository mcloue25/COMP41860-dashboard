## Smoke-Free Workplace Policy

Policy owner: UCD HR

Approval date and body: July 2020 UMT

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the commitment of the University to ensuring that the workplace is smoke-free and that all staff members have a right to work in smoke-free environment. Smoking and vaping/esmoking in all forms is prohibited in all workplaces throughout the campus with no exceptions.

## 2. Definitions

Smoking and vaping/e-smoking in all forms is prohibited.

For the avoidance of confusion, vaping/e-smoking relates to the use of any non-tobacco based device from which material is drawn into the body by inhalation, irrespective of whether or not a vapour is released or the product contains nicotine.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all staff members, students, service users, customers and visitors.

## 4. Principles

In order to ensure that workplaces are kept free from Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) or passive smoking, the University may from time to time designate areas outside of buildings as No Smoking Zones. Designation of such areas will be undertaken in order to eliminate, minimise and reduce employee exposure to ETS and further to ensure in so far as is practicable that ETS does not enter the workplaces. All persons must refrain from smoking or vaping/e-smoking in such areas.

Infringements by staff and students will be dealt with under the UCD disciplinary procedures.

Failure to adhere to relevant legislation with respect to tobacco products may lead to prosecution by the statutory authorities. Complaints regarding breaches of this legislation only should be notified to the SIRC, formerly Safety Office on extension 8768.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

Overall responsibility for policy implementation rests with the occupier, manager or other person for the time being in charge of the workplace.

All staff and students have an obligation to adhere to, and facilitate the implementation of this policy.

Managers shall inform all existing employees, students, consultants and contractors of the policy in the implementation and monitoring of the policy.
