## 1. Purpose

UCD is Ireland's global university, an inclusive community and a driver of positive action  for  social  responsibility  and  sustainability,  and  these  attributes  will  be evident across our actions . Responsible investment is a positive action that UCD should undertake to help create a more equitable, ethical and sustainable future for  all,  especially  our  students.  It  encompasses  considerations  of  social  justice, ethical conduct, governance and environmental impact. Responsible investment can  make  a  positive  contribution  to  the  world  alongside  our  education  and research as well as mitigate risks to our financial investments. Equally, responsible investment will help us to action the do no significant harm principle.

This policy ensures that Environmental, Social and Governance considerations are embedded  in  our  investment  processes,  alongside  more  traditional  financial considerations.  The  policy  does  not  override  other  policies,  specifically  the Treasury  Management  Policy.  This  policy  alongside  other  policies,  such  as  the Sustainable  Procurement  Policy,  is  important  in  helping   UCD  to  live  out  its ambition to be a positive and responsible societal actor and meet net zero by 2040.

## 2. Scope

UCD limits the scope of this financial item to stocks, bonds, investment and money market funds, it excludes research projects. The vast majority of our investments represent Treasury Funds and so are necessarily (relatively) short-term and in particular instruments only. UCD typically does not hold equity investments and so has limited opportunity to directly influence via our investments.

The  interpretation  of  all  University  investments  includes  UCD  wholly  owned subsidiaries, and excludes spin-in or start-up campus companies of which UCD is only  a partial shareholder. Environmental, Social and Governance considerations apply fully to these included investments.

Any  new  relevant  commercial  activity  or  investment  will  be  subject  to  this responsible investment policy. As per current practice, governance of military or dual use items occurs through Export Control Legislation, overseen by the DETE, &amp; our internal compliance programme.

## 3. Definitions

Entities  earning  greater  than  40%  of  their  revenue  from  weapons  or  military equipment will be classified as weapons or military manufacturers. UCD may rely on assurances from an entity itself and/or expertise, research and information provided by well-established financial data providers in making this assessment.

## 4. Principles

In investing responsibly we will be guided by:

## 1. UN Principles for Responsible Investment .

UCD will become a formal signatory to the principles.

The principles are set out below and further information is available at www.unpri.org

Principle 1 :  We  will  incorporate  ESG  issues into  investment analysis and decision-making processes;

Principle 2 : We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices;

Principle 3 : We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest;

Principle  4 :  We  will  promote  acceptance  and  implementation  of  the Principles within the investment industry;

Principle  5 :  We  will  work  together  to  enhance  our  effectiveness  in implementing the Principles;

Principle 6 : We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles.

## 2. UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) .

Sustainability is a key behaviour and action within our University strategy and integrated into much of our teaching, research and operational activity. It is appropriate to embed this behaviour in our investment processes and decisions.

## 3. EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).

This provides a clear regulatory context for much of our investment in Money Market Funds and sovereign bonds. Further information is set out in Appendix 1.

## 5. Approach to responsible investing

We will seek to:

utilise  EU  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure  Regulation  Article  8  or above products when investing in Money Market Funds. Such funds 'have a sustainable investment objective' (Article 9) or 'promote social and/or environmental characteristics, and may invest in sustainable investments, but do not have sustainable investing as a core objec tive' (Article 8);

consider Sovereigns' Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) indicators when investing in Sovereign Bonds, only investing in sovereigns in the top 50%. These  indicators  are  set  out  in  the  EU  SFDR  and  are  linked  with  the principal 'do no significant harm';

select  sustainable  products where  suitable  when  investing  e.g.  Green Bonds,  Green  Deposits  and  named  Sustainable  Money  Market  Funds. Suitability includes meeting our Treasury Management Policy's requirements;

consider  the  UN  SDGs in  our  direct  equity  investments  and  in  our ownership of subsidiaries;

ensure  that  any  equity  funds  we  invest  in are  guided  by  similar principles;

implement the Code of Governance for Subsidiary Companies of Irish Universities in  our  governance  of  subsidiaries;  where  exceptions  occur they will be reported in the Annual Governance Statement to the Audit &amp; Risk Management Committee of the Governing Authority;

communicate our ESG expectations and encourage the development of further sustainable investment products when engaging with counterparties and intermediaries ;

not invest directly in weapons or military manufacturers and use our best endeavours to ensure that such companies are screened out of our MMF investments.

## 6. Reporting

The  Bursar  will  report  annually  to  the  Finance,  Remuneration  and  Asset Management Committee of the Governing Authority (FRAMC) on the location of all university investments.

UCD will disclose all financial ties to FRAMC, with all partner countries including stocks,  bonds  and  investment  funds  subject  to  potential  commercial  data sensitivities and data incompleteness due to system limitations.

Annual Sustainability Reporting on investments will also include:

EU SFDR classifications and disclosures of our Money Market Funds e.g. setting out the screening processes of the MMFs;

EU  SFDR  Indicator  Reporting  by  Sovereigns  for  the  countries  we  have invested in. Reporting will include the mandatory indicators and the other indicators;

Our activities and progress towards implementing the UN Principles for Responsible Investment;

The carbon footprint of our investments, including bank deposit counterparties, subject to data availability;

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

The Bursar will be responsible for the implementation of this policy on approval by the Governing Authority.

## 8. Appendix 1 -EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation

## SFDR Product Classifications (for MMFs)

Three different product categorisations result from EU SFDR:

"Article 6" products either integrate financially material environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk considerations into the investment decision-making process, or  explain  why  sustainability  risk  is  not  relevant,  but  do  not  meet  the  additional criteria of Article 8 or Article 9 products.

'Article  8'  products  promote  social  and/or  environmental  characteristics,  and may invest in sustainable investments, but do not have sustainable investing as a core objective.

'Article 9' products have a sustainable investment objective.

There are additional requirements for a 'named' fund ie one using ESG or Sustainable as part of the fund name as outlined in the ESMA Naming Guidelines. A 'sustainability named'  Article  8  fund  would  typically  be  considered  to  be  broadly  equivalent  in sustainability terms to an Article 9 fund.

## SFDR Sovereign Bonds

SFDR  requires  the  disclosure  of  Principal  Adverse  Impact  indicators,  which  are divided into 'mandatory indicators' and 'additional indicators.' The SFDR requires Sovereigns  and  supranationals  to  report  on  2  mandatory  indicators  and  opt  in  to disclose other indicators from a list of additional indicators.
