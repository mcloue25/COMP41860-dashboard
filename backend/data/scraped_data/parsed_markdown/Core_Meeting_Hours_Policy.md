Approval date and body 14 March 2017, UMT

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to communicate and facilitate the embedding of core meeting hours across the University, as part of a range of actions intended to support a family-friendly working environment. The policy was proposed by the Athena Swan Steering Group with the endorsement of UMT EDI and approved by UMT on14 March 2017.

## 2. Definitions

Core meeting hours are defined as the hours between 9:30am and 4pm, Monday to Friday. They do not represent the working day, but rather are a subset of the working day.

Meetings include all University, College and School level meetings, seminars, workshops etc. which faculty and staff are either required or invited to attend. They do not include timetabled teaching or assessment.

## 3. Scope

The policy applies to all members of the University community.

## 4. Principles

The University is committed to creating an environment whereby all members of the University community have equal opportunity to be kept informed and to contribute to both local and institutional decision making. The establishment of core meeting hours ensures that decisions are informed by the broadest possible range of expertise and input, and through enabling participation, will enhance a sense of community and shared endeavour.

Meetings will not normally be scheduled outside core meeting hours. Exceptions may be accommodated for occasional events notified in advance, to support broad engagement from those with roles external to the university, or where colleagues mutually agree to meet outside core hours . Satisfaction with implementation of the policy and its impact will be monitored through staff surveys.

This policy does not change existing contractual hours and/or obligations.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

Heads of Colleges, Schools and Support Units are responsible and accountable to UMT for the  effective local implementation of this policy, and for creating a culture within which the participation of  all members of the University community is enabled and valued.
