## 1 Introduction

As set out in our strategy,

'UCD values excellence and understands that excellent performance requires excellent people working in a supportive environment'.

The strategy also states that:

'UCD will continue to attract excellent and diverse students, faculty and staff from around Ireland and around the world, and will put in place appropriate support measures to develop and retain the members of our community'.

The strategy commits to working to ensure that the University's faculty and staff are enabled to achieve their full potential and are appropriately rewarded for their contribution.

## 2 Key Principles

Applications  for  promotion  are  considered  on  a  rolling  basis  by  the  Faculty Promotions Committee. All applications are judged on an individual basis against the UCD Development Framework for Faculty.  There is no internal quota system in place for Faculty promotions.

## 3 Equality and Diversity

The  University  is  committed  to  advancing  equality  of  opportunity  and  in sustaining an environment that values and celebrates the diversity of its faculty and  is  steadfastly  committed  to  non-discrimination  and  promotion  of  equal opportunity on the grounds of age, civil status, disability, family status, gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, and membership of the Traveller community.

The mechanism and process for determining academic excellence in promotions shall uphold the University's commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.

Consideration  is  given  to  any  personal,  family  or  non-academic  circumstances since the candidate's last promotion or appointment, brought to the attention of  the  Committee,  which  may  have  impacted  on  performance  for  a  limited period.

The University welcomes applications from both full-time and part-time faculty.

Recognising  the  objective  of  the  University  Strategy  2015-2020  to  promote gender balance and equality of opportunity among students and employees of the University, the University acknowledges that females are under-represented at Professor and Full Professor level and encourages female academics to apply for promotion, at their discretion.

## Faculty Promotion Policy

## 4 Eligibility to Apply for Promotion

Candidates  for  promotion  will  not  have  reached  the  normal  retirement  age 1 prior  to  the  effective  date  of  promotion.  Normally,  a  period  of  continuous employment of three years at UCD is expected prior to applying for promotion. Simultaneous applications for promotion to different levels are not permitted. Candidates  applying  for  promotion  through  the  standard  rolling  promotions process may only apply for promotion to the level above their current level.

## 5 Frequency

Candidates may submit an application online at any time following consultation and input from their Head of School and College Principal. Normally, the Faculty Promotions Committee will meet on a monthly basis nine times a year.

The Faculty Promotions Committee normally processes applications in the order they are received, but delays may result from the time taken to obtain external reviews and at certain times of the year if application numbers are high 2 .

## 6 Performance for Growth

The  Performance  for  Growth  process  provides  a  framework  which,  amongst other  things,  is  explicitly  intended  to  support  members  of  faculty  who  are considering promotion. It includes reviewing readiness using the criteria laid out in  the  Faculty  Development  Framework,  and  where  necessary  putting  a development  plan  in  place  in  order  to  address  any  gaps.  In  this  context  it  is intended  that  applicants  will  utilise  the  P4G  framework  to  support  their preparation and related development .

## 7 Assessment of Applications

All candidates for promotion are assessed under the following 3 criteria:

-  Research, Scholarship and Innovation
-  Teaching and Learning
-  Leadership and Contribution

Candidates are assessed against the UCD Development Framework for Faculty. Candidates  are  expected  to  make  a  clear  and  unequivocal  case  that  they  are currently performing at the level to which they are applying, with a clear upward trajectory, and that they have the drive and capacity to continue performing at that level. Candidates should refer to the Development Framework for Faculty

1 A candidate should refer to their contract of employment for details on their retirement age.

2 Applications for promotion under Academic Retention may be processed and assessed ahead of applications made through the standard promotion route.

## Faculty Promotion Policy

when making this case, and should place emphasis on achievements since their last promotion or since arriving at UCD, whichever is most recent.

On receipt of an application for promotion, the Faculty Promotions Committee determines if there is a prima facie case to assess the application.

The purpose of the prima facie test is to exclude a candidate who, in the view of the Faculty Promotions Committee, has failed to meet the satisfactory standard in  one  or  more  dimension  or  where  it  is  the  view  of  the  Faculty  Promotions Committee that  the  candidate  has  not  provided  evidence  in  the  aggregate  of meeting the standard required for promotion to the appropriate grade.

If the Faculty Promotions Committee determines that:

-  a prima facie case does not exist, feedback is provided to the candidate;
-  a prima facie case exists, the application is advanced to External Assessors.

## 8  The Role of the Candidate

## 8.1 Prior to Submission

Prior  to  submitting  an  application  for  promotion,  the  candidate  must  ensure that they have completed the following steps in the promotional process: -

-  Candidates will discuss their application with their Head of School 3 . Part of the conversation with the Head of School should be in relation to the candidate's  overall  development.  When  the  Performance  for  Growth process is established, an agreed development plan will form part of the submission for promotion.
-  Candidates  nominate  three  External  Assessors  as  per  the  guidelines outlined in the section 'The Role of the External Assessor'.
- o Note:  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  candidate  to  ensure  that  each External Assessor cited is available and willing to respond to requests from the University.
-  Candidates may include the names of up to two external assessors that they do not wish to be considered as external assessors.

## 8.2 Application Process

Applications may be submitted on a rolling basis at the candidate's discretion.

3 In the case of candidates with joint appointments, this is the Head of School to which the should discuss their application with their College Principal.  Where the candidate is a College Principal, they should discuss their application with the President or his nominee.

## Faculty Promotion Policy

Candidates  who  wish  to  apply  for  promotion  are  required  to  submit  their application through UCD's InfoHub. Applications should be effectively presented;  thorough  yet  concise,  and  comply  with  the  word  or  length  limits where indicated. Where a candidate has previously applied unsuccessfully for promotion, a statement detailing how the feedback from that application has been addressed must be provided.

Candidates  must  provide  details  of  their  employment  history.  A  template document, for this purpose can be found on the HR website. The completed document is to be uploaded through InfoHub.

Re-application  within  one  year  of  an  unsuccessful  application  will  only  be permitted  in  cases  where  there  are  substantial  new  achievements  since  the previous  application.    Candidates  are  strongly  advised  to  engage  with  the Performance  for  Growth  process  before  resubmitting  an  application  for promotion.

The  Head  of  School  and  College  Principal  will  provide  a  commentary,  via InfoHub on the candidate's application (see sections 9 and 10).  Each candidate is entitled to submit a response to these commentaries.

## 9 The Role of the Head of School

The Head of School will: -

-  Provide a short commentary on the candidate's application for promotion. The  Head  of  School  will  also  comment  on  the  candidate's engagement  with  the  Performance  for  Growth  process.  The  Head  of School  should  consult  and  seek  comments  from  senior  members  of Faculty in the candidate's discipline prior to providing this commentary 4 .
-  Discuss  the  application  with  the  potential  candidate.  This  conversation should also focus on the developmental needs of the candidate.
-  In the case that the candidate has previously applied unsuccessfully for promotion, the Head of School will comment on the extent to which the feedback on that application has been addressed.
-  The Head of School will nominate
- o Five  External  Assessors  for  applicants  applying  for  promotion  to Professor or Full Professor;
- o Four  External  Assessors  for  applicants  applying  for  promotion  to Associate Professor.

ensure that all of the proposed assessors are not of the same gender. The Head of School's list of nominees will not be shared with the candidate. Further details are contained in the section relating to External Assessor reports.

-  In  the  case  where  the  candidate  is  a  Head  of  School  or  the  College Principal  also  undertakes  the  Head  of  School  function,  the  College Principal will nominate a senior member of Faculty to undertake the role of Head of School with respect to this Policy. In the case of the candidate being a College Principal, the President will nominate a senior member of Faculty to undertake this role.

## 10 The Role of the College Principal

The College Principal will: -

-  Review the application for promotion and the Head of School's commentary  and  provide  further  commentary  on  the  application  for promotion.  This  commentary  will  be  available  to  the  candidate  for comment.  The  candidate  has  a  right  to  reply  to  the  commentary.    All three commentaries will be included in the application.
-  Review the list of nominated External Assessors provided by the Head of School and may comment  on or add to this list taking gender representation into consideration. The list of nominees from the Head of School and College Principal will not be shared with the candidate. The College  Principal  may  liaise  with  senior  members  of  Faculty  in  the candidate's discipline but should not discuss the list with the candidate.
-  In the case where the candidate is a College Principal, the President will nominate a senior member of Faculty to undertake this role.

## 11 The Role of the Faculty Promotions Committee

The Faculty Promotions Committee will:

Membership of the FPC is subject to review by the President and approval by the Governing Authority. Membership of the Committee is subject to review by the President, as required.

The  selection of the President's nominees  ensures  that  there  is  gender representation on the Committee. It is the University's  commitment to have a minimum of 40% of either gender on the Faculty Promotions Committee on a comply or explain basis.

## Faculty Promotion Policy

## 14 The External Assessor

External Assessors should be: -

-  At  the  level  of  Full  Professor,  or  in  the  case  of  Associate  Professor promotions,  at  least,  at  the  level  of  Professor  (or  the  corresponding equivalence to the level of a Professor at UCD)
-  In  a  leading  academic  institution,  or  have  retired  from  such  a  position within the past five years
-  A leading academic with an international profile
-  Cognisant of the norms within the candidate's academic discipline and be qualified  to  comment  on  the  candidate's  achievements  and  her/his suitability for promotion 5
-  Have no apparent conflict of interest. 6

## 14.1 The Role of the External Assessor

External Assessors are required to give an assessment of the applications for promotion  sent  to  them  for  review  and  not  provide  a  reference  for  the candidate.

External  Assessors  are  required  to  comply  with  the  principles  of  the  UCD Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  policy  as  they  undertake  their  assessment. External Assessors are asked if they have undertaken Unconscious Bias training and encouraged to do so if they previously have not.

External Assessors are required to assess the overall academic performance of the candidate. They are invited to provide an independent, unbiased assessment of the level of the candidate's achievements in Research, Scholarship and Innovation, Teaching &amp; Learning and Academic Leadership and Contribution, with reference to the UCD Development Framework for Faculty, taking into account the norms for the discipline.

In addition, External Assessors are invited to comment on:

-  Whether there is clear evidence of an upward trajectory
-  Whether  the  case  meets  international  standards  for  promotion  to  the relevant level

5 This does not require that the external assessor be active in precisely the same discipline or sub-discipline as the candidate. Rather, the requirement is to be familiar with standards of excellence in that discipline and thus qualified to assess the candidate against the criteria.

6 An external assessor is deemed to have a conflict of interest if he/she has a professional or personal relationship with  the  candidate  that  could  reasonably  call  into  question  an  assessor's  ability  to  give  an  objective  assessment  of  the application. This would include a supervisor/student relationship, past membership of the same school/research group, and/or close/repeated co-authorship.

-  How  the  application  compares  with  recent  successful  applications  for promotion to the equivalent level within the assessor's own institution

## 14.2 The External Assessor Nomination Process

A candidate nominates three potential external assessors for approval by the Faculty  Promotions  Committee.  The  candidate  must  confirm  that  each External Assessor nominated is available and willing to undertake this duty. Candidates should ensure that all of the proposed assessors are not of the same  gender.  Candidates  may  include  the  names  of  up  to  two  external assessors that they do not wish to be considered as external assessors.

The Head of School/College Principal will nominate:

- o Five  External  Assessors  for  applicants  applying  for  promotion  to Professor or Full Professor
- o Four  External  Assessors  for  applicants  applying  for  promotion  to Associate Professor

Prior  to  the  application  being  submitted,  the  Head  of  School/  College Principal must confirm that each External Assessor nominated is available and willing to undertake this duty.

## Applications for promotion to Associate Professor

Where  it  is satisfied that a  prima  facie  case  for  promotion  has  been established,  the  Faculty  Promotions  Committee  will  approve  two  external assessors, including one nominated by the candidate.  External Assessors are requested  to  provide  a  written  report  on  the  candidate's  application  for promotion.

## Applications for promotion to Professor and Full Professor

Where  it  is satisfied that a  prima  facie  case  for  promotion  has  been established,  the  Faculty  Promotions  Committee  will  approve  three  external assessors, including one nominated by the candidate. The approved External Assessors  are  requested  to  provide  a  written  report  on  the  candidate's application for promotion.

The  Head  of  School  and  College  Principal  should  seek  advice  from  senior academic colleagues when forming the long list of potential External Assessors. In larger Schools, a Head of School may nominate a Section Head to provide a list of potential External Assessors, if appropriate.

Please note: An application for promotion cannot be considered until the required number of External Assessor reports for the candidate, has been received.

## Faculty Promotion Policy

## 15 Conclusion of the Assessment Process

Following the Faculty Promotions Committee meeting:

-  The Faculty Promotions Committee's recommendations are forwarded to the President for approval.
-  Candidates  are  informed  in  writing  of  the  decision  in  respect  of  their application and the reason/s for that decision.
-  If  candidates  require  copies  of  their  External  Assessor  reports  they should contact the Freedom of Information Office.
-  College Principals and Heads of Schools are informed of the outcome of the assessment process in relation to candidates from their School/College.
-  A list of promoted candidates is forwarded to the Academic Council and Governing Authority for noting, annually.
-  External  Assessors  are  advised  of  the  outcome  for  the  candidate  for whom they provided a reference.
-  The effective date of promotions is the date that the Faculty Promotions Committee's recommendation for promotion is approved by the President.

## 16 Feedback

Accurate notes are taken as part of the process that reflect the basis of the decision  made.  In  the  interests  of  transparency,  best  practice  and  staff development, at the conclusion of the process, all candidates are given written feedback  on  their  application,  by  the  Faculty  Promotions  Committee.  In addition,  unsuccessful  candidates  will  be  given  the  opportunity  for  oral feedback  from  the  Chairperson,  or  nominee,  and  one  other  member  of  the Faculty Promotions Committee.

These notes support the communication of the promotion decision so that an applicant has sufficient clarity and a link is developed between the feedback received and the Performance for Growth process, when established, so that feedback is incorporated into an individual's development plan.

Candidates  attending  a  feedback  meeting  may  be  accompanied  by  either  a UCD colleague or a representative from their union, if applicable. The name of the colleague/representative, and their relationship to the candidate, must be forwarded to the HR Promotions and Grading Office 3 working days prior to the feedback meeting.

## 17 Confidentiality

Confidentiality, by all participants, is maintained throughout the process.  All discussion  during  the  assessment  process  and  any data  generated  remains confidential  to  the  members  of  the  Faculty  Promotions  Committee.      The names  of  promoted  candidates  will  not  be  released  until  the  President  has

approved the recommendations of the Faculty Promotions Committee and the candidates have been advised accordingly.

## 18 Freedom of Information

The University comes under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 2014. This legislation confers on individuals a legal right of access to information held by  the  University  concerning  them  and  a  legal  right  to  receive  reasons  for decisions that have materially affected them.

However, without recourse to the Freedom of Information Act, candidates will at  the  conclusion  of  the  assessment  process,  receive  a  detailed  written  note that  supports  the  communication  of  the  promotion  decision  so  that  the applicant has sufficient clarity as to the basis of the decision. Other assessment records, with the exception of those of the external assessor, such as minutes, personal notes, discussion documents, and correspondence will also be made available if requested.

All  assessment  records  should  therefore  be  sufficiently  clear  and  detailed  to fulfil a request for the reasons for the decisions.

Other documents are available if required through the Freedom of Information process.

- 19  Appeals (Text  as  agreed  between  UCD  and  SIPTU,  IFUT  on  10 th November

2017)

- I. The  Faculty  Promotions  Appeals  Committee  (FPAC)  will  be  established  as  an independent committee.  Once membership has been proposed as set out in clause ii, it will be approved by the Governing Authority.
- II. The FPAC will be composed of five members, to be appointed as follows:

The  members  of  the  FPAC  will  not  be  members  of  the  Faculty  Promotions Committee (FPC).

- III. All  parties  will  seek  to  ensure  that  there  are  at  least  two  members  of  each gender on the FPAC.
- IV. The FPAC will be supported by UCD Legal.

Candidates who have not been recommended for promotion by the FPC shall be afforded the opportunity to receive written and oral feedback in relation to their  applications.  An  appeal  shall  only  be  considered  by  the  FPAC  after  the candidate  has  attended  for  oral  feedback.  Appeals  must  be  lodged  with  the University  no  later  than  sixty  days  following  the  meeting  at  which  oral feedback is provided.

- V. The FPAC shall hear appeals made, in writing, by candidates for promotion to be based on alleged defects in the application of the procedures for promotion set out in the university's policies and procedures. The only basis of an appeal shall be an alleged failure by the FPC to observe due process, which is defined as:
2. -Failure  to  follow  in  due  manner  University  policy  and  procedures  for  the consideration  of  applications  for  promotion.    All  University  policies  and procedures are subject to statutory/anti-discriminatory requirements;
3. -Denial of natural justice;
4. -Unfair  or  unreasonable  application  of  the criteria for the granting of promotions.
- VI. The  appellant  is  required  to  specify  the  grounds  of  the  appeal  and  to demonstrate why the promotions process was so defective as to influence the decision. In making  the appeal, the appellant may  provide reasonable additional  information  to  substantiate  their  claim.  Any  such  new  material should be germane to, and substantiate, the procedural defect and the FPAC may accept or reject this new information.
- VII. In considering an appeal, the FPAC shall provide the FPC with the opportunity to comment on the appeal.
- VIII. The FPAC will determine whether any of the alleged procedural defects could have  influenced  the  outcome.    They  will  have  available  to  them  all  the materials available to the FPC.
- IX. While the setting of academic standards to be used in the promotion process is a  matter  for  the  exclusive  competence  of  the  FPC,  the  application  of  those standards in a case may be reviewed by the FPAC.  Nothing in this process shall have the effect of substituting a differing academic judgement arrived at by the FPAC  for  the  academic  judgement  validly  arrived  at  by  the  FPC  following review.
- X. The FPAC may come to one of the following conclusions:

## Faculty Promotion Policy

UCD Human Resources Acmhainní Daonna UCD

- -No procedural defects. The appeal is not upheld. The FPAC should provide the appellant and the FPC with a clear rationale for its decision in writing;
- -Procedural  defects  are  found  to  have  occurred,  but  they  are  found  not  to have influenced the outcome. The appeal is not upheld. The  FPAC should provide the  appellant  and  the  FPC  with  a  clear  rationale  for  its  decision  in writing.  The attention of the FPC is drawn to the defects and they are asked to ensure that a remedy is put in place.  The FPC should inform the FPAC of the intended remedial action;
- -Procedural defects are found to have occurred and they are deemed to have had the potential to influence the outcome. The appeal is upheld. The FPAC should inform the appellant of its decision and of its consequences in writing. The FPAC request that the FPC rectifies the defects and recommends that the FPC reconsider the decision or decisions affected.  The FPAC shall supply the FPC  with  sufficient  detail  of  the  procedural  defect  to  allow  the  FPC  to understand the basis of the decision.
- XI. Where an appeal is upheld, the FPC is required to rectify the defects found by the FPAC and to re-examine the application or applications affected.
- XII. The FPC will provide the FPAC with a report outlining the steps taken to rectify the defects and the outcome of the reconsideration of the application.
- XIII. The  reconsideration  of  the  application(s)  may  come  to  one  of  the  following conclusions:
- -Reject the original outcome. The re-examination of the application results in a  recommendation  to  promote  the  candidate.    This  recommendation  is forwarded to the President according to procedure, but the effective date of promotion will be the date of the original decision of the President.  The FPC will provide the rationale and inform the FPAC of its decision;
- -Accept the original outcome. The FPC will respond to the FPAC outlining in detail the basis of its decision.
- XIV. The FPAC, having considered this explanation, may;
- -Return  the  application  to  the  FPC  for  additional  clarification  on  stated grounds.
- -Make  a  recommendation  directly  to  the  President  for  promotion  of  the appellant. In taking this step, the FPAC must provide the President with its judgement including addressing:
- o Why the response of the FPC was not sufficient to address the basis of the appeal;
- o How this recommendation complies fully with clause IX of this document.
- XV. The  President  will  normally  accept  the  recommendation  of  the  FPAC.    The President will provide an explanation for his decision to the FPAC and the FPC.
- XVI. At  the  conclusion  of  the  appeals  process,  the  FPAC  will  communicate  its decision to the appellant providing a clear basis for the final determination.
