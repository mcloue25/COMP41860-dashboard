## Job Sharing for Non-Academic Employees Policy

Policy owner: UCD HR

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the Policy and Procedures related to the Job Sharing Scheme for all non-academic employees of the University except Technical employees (a separate Job Sharing policy exists for this category of employee). The purpose of the scheme is to allow employees to opt for a more flexible working arrangement for a temporary/indefinite period in order to facilitate the balancing of work with other commitments.

## 2.Definitions

Job Sharing is a way two people voluntarily share the duties of one post between them. Each job-sharer receives a pro rata salary and terms and conditions for the time worked.

## 3.Scope

All permanent, non-academic employees of the University, except Technical employees, who have successfully completed a probation period of 12 months will be eligible to apply for their post to be considered for job share.

## 4.Principles

- a. The University in consultation with the Head of School/Unit will determine whether a post is suitable for job sharing.
- b. All eligible employees will be entitled to apply for their post to be considered for job sharing. The University reserves the right to make the final determination with regard to specific posts and to determine an appropriate number of posts eligible for job sharing at any time. The University cannot guarantee a job sharing facility to all interested employees, but all applications will be fairly considered.
- c. An employee who wishes to have their job considered for job sharing should apply initially to their Head of School/Unit. The Head of School/Unit will then consider this application - in consultation with UCD Human Resources - and the final decision will be communicated to the applicant by the Head of School/Unit.
- d. In the event that an application for job sharing is not agreed the applicant will receive a written explanation of this decision from the Head of School/Unit.
- e. If it is decided that a post is unsuitable for job sharing the post holder would still be eligible to apply as a job sharer for any other suitable job sharing post advertised.

- f. If it is agreed that a post is suitable for job sharing applications will be invited from other suitably qualified staff of the University.
- g. An assessment process will take place to select the job sharing partner. If no suitable partner can be found, the post will remain full-time and the current post holder will be advised in writing accordingly by the Head of School/Unit.
- h. That member of staff would still be free to apply as a job sharing partner for any other suitable job sharing post advertised. Further they can re-apply for their existing post to be considered for job sharing one year from the date on which they were notified that no suitable partner could be found.
- i. Job sharers may be appointed to share one job which is divided between two or more Schools/Units. This would be equivalent to a current full time job which is divided between two or more locations.

## 5.Conditions of Service

Conditions of service which apply to the permanent full time post will be shared on a pro rata basis between the two job sharers. Except where otherwise stated, job sharers are bound by the existing conditions of employment including all policies and procedures.

## Job content and description

Job sharers are sharing a single full time job which will retain the job description, in terms of duties and responsibilities, of the job as a whole.

## Attendance Arrangements:

The principle governing attendance arrangements under the scheme is that two employees will share equally the normal working hours of the single, full time post in accordance with the agreed working arrangements. However there may be occasions where for specific reasons the normal working hours are not shared equally. The actual working arrangements will be agreed by the Head of School/Unit in consultation with the job share partners, taking into account the needs of the School/Unit. These may include:

- 2.5 days per week
- 3 days one week/2 days the following week
- All mornings every week/all afternoons every week
- Half the daily/weekly hours of full-time staff

It may be desirable, in some jobs, to arrange for some overlap in working hours between the job share partners. This would be subject to discussion and agreement.

## Pay

For each post in which job share arrangements operate, the scale of pay applicable to job sharers will be 50% of the appropriate point of the scale applying to the post (may be more or less if working hours are not shared equally).

## Superannuation

The superannuation benefits of job sharers will be pro rata to those of full time staff on the basis that each year of job sharing will count as six months service for superannuation purposes.

## Annual Leave

Job sharers are entitled to half, or the appropriate proportion, of the annual leave they would be entitled to if working on a full time basis. Depending on the working arrangements, this could be calculated as half or appropriate proportion of the number of full days, or the full number of half days, e.g. paid for 10 full days or paid for 20 half days.

## Public and Privilege Holidays

Public and privilege holidays will be shared between job sharers proportionate to the amount of hours each works. Where necessary, attendance will be varied by agreement with local management with a view to allowing both job sharing partners to benefit from public and privilege holidays. The application of the Working Time Act 1997, with respect to the payment of public holidays to job sharers in UCD, is as follows;

Job sharers who work a split week, week on/off or a variable pattern of full working days, are entitled from the operation of the Act, to an additional half days pay for each bank holiday and privilege day that falls on a day where they are not scheduled to be at work. An employee may avail of a half days pay leave in lieu of pay, subject to work requirements.

Accordingly back payment of an additional half days pay will be applied to each job sharer not scheduled to be at work on a bank holiday or privilege day. As the pattern of job sharing in the University is variable, it is important that each employee consults their Head of School/Unit in order to advise UCD Human Resources on the appropriate payment for a bank or privilege holiday. In order to ensure processing of monthly salaries, UCD Human Resources should be notified at least six weeks prior to the holiday date.

## Sick Leave

The sick leave entitlements of job sharers will be pro rata to their entitlements if they were working on a full time basis and will depend on the PRSI status.

## Maternity Leave

The maternity leave entitlements of job sharers will be pro rata to their entitlements if they were working on a full time basis and will depend on the PRSI status.

## Return to Full Time Employment

A job sharer may at any time apply for suitable full time vacancies which are advertised within the University.

If one job share partner leaves the employment of the University or takes up another post, then the remaining job sharer will be offered the opportunity of taking the post up on a full time basis. If this does not suit the remaining job sharer and she/he wishes to remain working on a job sharing basis, the University may advertise for a job sharing partner. If however the University deems that the post is no longer suited to job sharing or if a suitable job sharing partner cannot be found, then the remaining job sharer may be required to take up the position on a full time basis.

The University reserves the right to require individual job sharers to return to full time work. Where this is the case, six months' notice to return to full time employment will be given by the University. This right will not however be exercised in order to provide cover during absences such as sick leave, annual leave or maternity leave of the job sharing partner.

If, after at least one year's job sharing, a job sharer wishes to return to full time employment with the University, then he/she should notify the University of this wish, giving as much advance notice as possible. The University will consider the returning job sharer for the first appropriate position which becomes vacant. It may also be necessary for the returning job sharer to compete with other internal applicants for this full time position.

## Training &amp; Development

Job sharing should not prevent job sharers from developing their career. The University will endeavour to ensure that job sharers have access to appropriate training and development

opportunities and are encouraged to develop their skills on an ongoing basis. Job sharers will be fully included in the University's PMDS procedures.

## Promotion

Job sharing staff will be eligible for promotion on the same basis as full time staff. While it may be possible in some cases for job sharing to continue on promotion an offer of promotion will normally be conditional on the job sharer concerned undertaking to perform the duties of the higher grade on the working arrangements relevant to the promoted post. Job sharers will be eligible to apply for personal promotion under the terms of the Personal Promotion Scheme applicable to their post. It is possible that this may result in personal promotion for one but not both job share partners depending on the outcome of the assessment process outlined in the Personal Promotion Scheme.

## Outside Employment

UCD remains the main employer of the employee throughout the period of their participation in the job sharing scheme. The approval of the University would therefore have to be obtained for any outside employment engaged in by the job sharer. All job sharing staff will be required to enter into a formal written undertaking that during the period of their service in this capacity they will not engage in any form of outside employment without the approval of the University.
