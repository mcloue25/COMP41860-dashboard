## Visiting Academic and Adjunct Staff Appointment Policy

## 1.  Introduction

It is recognised that the University:

-  Will  regularly  host  visiting  academics  from  other  higher  education institutions  who  spend  time  at  UCD  contributing  to  the  University's teaching, research and professional activities.
-  May be enriched by the services of persons in the community whose special  knowledge  or  expertise  complements  that  of  the  regular University Faculty.

A Visiting Academic or Adjunct Staff title is recognised as an honour bestowed upon an individual by the University.

Visiting Academic and Adjunct Staff are individuals whose appointment to the University will enhance the teaching or research profile of a School, Research Institute  or  College  and  contribute  to  the  intellectual  life  of  the  University benefiting both the appointee and the University.

A Visiting Academic will hold an academic post at the level of Lecturer/Assistant  Professor,  Research  Fellow,  Associate  Professor,  Senior Research  Fellow, Professor or Full Professor in a  comparable  higher education  institute  and  have  equal  or  superior  levels  of  expertise  and experience  to  those  of  regular  staff  performing  similar  activities.  They  will assume a Visiting  Academic  title  equivalent  to  that  which  they  hold  in  their home institution (i.e. their primary employer).

Adjunct Staff appointees include:

-  Individuals distinguished by high achievement in the world of industry, business, science, the professions, the arts or public service who have been recognised by peers as outstanding in their field;
-  Staff of the University 1 (excluding Faculty);
-  Retired UCD Faculty.

Adjunct Staff appointees will be given titles that are most appropriate in terms of academic rank recognising that academic experience may differ relative to faculty  who are employed at the University.  They will possess professional and/or academic qualifications and expertise comparable with those expected of faculty at a similar grade within the University.

1 A nominating Head of School may only nominate an individual from outside of her/his own school.  The nominating Head of School will have ensured that the nominee's Head of School/Line Manager agrees with the appointment. For the purpose of this footnote, the College of Business is treated as a School.
