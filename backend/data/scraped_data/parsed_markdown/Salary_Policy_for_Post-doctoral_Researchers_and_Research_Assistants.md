## Salary Policy for Post-Doctoral Researchers and Research Assistants

<!-- image -->

Policy owner: UCD HR

Approval date and body:

UMT,28 February 2023

## 1. Purpose

The UCD policy and associated options for managing salaries for Postdoctoral Research staff and Research Assistants are outlined below.

## 2. Definitions

Salary Point: The approved salary that may be paid to a researcher falling under the scope of this policy. It is important to note that the fixed salary points are not the same as pay scales, and automatic incremental progression does not apply.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to the following roles: Research Assistants, Post-doctoral Fellows l and ll and Research Fellows.

## 4. Principles

Appointments will be made at a set of agreed fixed salary points on a range. The Principal Investigator is responsible for proposing a salary at a point that is compatible with the applicant's skills and experience and competitive with their existing remuneration or remuneration being offered by other prospective employers. Where a PI wishes to appoint at a salary point above point 1, a salary exception form must be completed, approved and returned to UCD HR.

Fixed salary points can be found in the Resourcing section of the HR website.

## 5. Guidelines for determining salary point on range

The lowest fixed salary point should be used for all appointments, unless the appointee has significant  post-doctoral  research experience.

For roles where the Principal Investigator wishes to offer above point 1 a ' Salary Exception form ' must be completed.

The general guideline is that staff at each level should be paid within the relevant range of points, following consideration of the following factors:

1. Current salary of the appointee (please include details of total package and other benefits, where possible).
2. Relevant prior work experience of the appointee.
3. Market competitiveness for the discipline.
4. Supporting information highlighting the difficulty in attracting candidates (e.g. post advertised previously).
5. Funding and grants that are likely to follow the appointee if hired.
6. Criticality of filling the post to support courses offered to students

## Exceptions

Roles funded by agencies or programmes and which dictate a particular rate of pay. In these cases, the rate of pay indicated should be the guide and their policy on cost of living or other reviews will also apply. Examples include IRC awards and Marie Curie Award

## 6. Roles and responsibilities

The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for proposing a salary at a point that is compatible with the applicant's skills and experience and competitive with their existing remuneration or remuneration being offered by other prospective employers.
