## Introduction and Context

This  document  outlines  the  approved  procedures  for  the  emergence  of  new  subjects  and  the review of existing subjects in the University. These procedures were last updated and approved by the Academic Council Executive Committee at its meeting of 26 September 2018.

Where the appointment of a new Head of Subject or the extension of an existing Head of Subject appointment  is  required,  the Procedures  for  the  Appointment  of  Head  of  Subject should  be followed.

## UCD Subject Register

The  University  publishes  the  UCD  Subject  Register  which  lists  all  approved  subjects  in  the University and approved Heads of Subject. The emergence of a new subject, the review of an existing subject, and the appointment of a new Head of Subject constitute an amendment to the UCD Subject Register.

The UCD Subject Register is noted at the first meeting of the Academic Council each year.

## Procedures for the Emergence of a New Subject

Where the need for a subject not currently listed on the UCD Subject Register is identified, the below procedures should be followed:

- a. The  Head  of  School,  following  consultation  within  a  School  and,  where  appropriate, across  Schools,  proposes  a  subject  for  approval  to  the  College  Principal.  In  order become an  established  subject  of  the  university,  the  proposal  to  the  College  Principal should  include  a  written  justification  for  the  new  subject,  indicating  how  it  satisfies  the following criteria:
- A number of academic staff identify the subject as their primary academic area
- The subject contributes to an academic taught programme
- There is a case for the visibility of the subject area at national and/or international level

A  timeline  for  the  introduction  of  the  new  subject  should  be  specified,  along  with information as to how the existence of the subject will be communicated.

- b. Where  the  College  Principal  supports  the  proposal,  the  proposer  completes  the  'New Subject Proposal Form'.
- c. Where a new subject is proposed, the proposed Head of Subject must be included for consideration also.
- d. This  form  is  submitted  to  the  Academic  Council,  or  its  Executive  Committee,  who  will consider the proposed addition to the UCD Subject Register.
- e. Where the Academic Council, or its Executive Committee, approve the establishment of a new subject, the UCD Subject Register will be updated accordingly.

- f. The  UCD  Subject  Register  for  a  given  academic  year  will  be  presented  to  Academic Council  at  its  first  meeting  of  that  academic  year,  typically  in  November.  Subsequent changes to the UCD Subject Register will not be presented to Academic Council until the following academic year.
- g. The proposer will be informed of the decision by University Secretariat.

## Procedures for the Review of an Existing Subject

Where the need to review or amend an existing subject on the UCD Subject Register arises, the below procedures should be followed:

- a. The  Head  of  School,  following  consultation  within  a  School  and,  where  appropriate, across  Schools,  proposes  an  amendment  of  a  subject  for  approval  to  the  College Principal.  The  proposal  should  include  a  written  justification  for  the  amendment  to  the existing subject (for example, change of subject name).
- b. Where the College Principal supports the proposal, the proposer completes the 'Amendment to Existing Subject Form'.
- c. This  form  is  submitted  to  the  Academic  Council,  or  its  Executive  Committee,  who  will consider the proposed amendment.
- d. Where the Academic Council, or its Executive Committee, approve the amendment to a subject, the UCD Subject Register will be updated accordingly.
- e. The  UCD  Subject  Register  for  a  given  academic  year  will  be  presented  to  Academic Council  at  its  first  meeting  of  that  academic  year,  typically  in  November.  Subsequent changes to the UCD Subject Register will not be presented to Academic Council until the following academic year.
- f. The proposer will be informed of the decision by University Secretariat.

## Responsibilities

The Academic Council, supported by University Secretariat, is responsible for the maintenance of the UCD Subject Register and its publication on the University website.

Schools are responsible for the communication of proposed subjects and amendments to the UCD Subject Register to the appropriate approval body. Only those subjects approved by the Academic Council, or its Executive Committee, through the specified approval mechanism and included on the UCD Subject Register, will be considered the official subjects of the University.

All  forms  related  to  this  procedure  are  subject  to  review  by  University  Secretariat  and  may  be updated where deemed necessary.
