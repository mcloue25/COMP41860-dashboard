Approval date and body

11 May 2022, UMT

This policy document has been developed following desk-based research into best practice nationally  and  internationally,  extensive  internal  consultation  through  externally  facilitated focus  groups,  written  submissions  and  individual  meetings  and  external  consultation  with experts in the area of dignity and respect. This policy is one element of a broad framework to work towards a culture of dignity and respect at UCD to include but not limited to: targeted training for key roles, an ongoing University-wide awareness raising campaign and training, dedicated full-time and voluntary support roles and a range of supporting documentation such as visual aids.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy and supplementary materials, including the Support and Guidance document and the Formal Investigation Procedures document, is to support the development of a working and learning environment in which bullying and harassment are unacceptable and where individuals have the confidence and trust in the process to come forward, in the knowledge that their concerns will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.

University  College  Dublin  has  six  core  values  driving  our  culture:  Excellence;  Integrity;  Collegiality; Engagement; Diversity and Creativity.  In  line  with  these  values,  the  University  is  committed  to  the provision of an environment of respect for diversity and equality of opportunity where:

- you have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and can work and study in a rewarding, safe and stress free environment;
- bullying and harassment will not be tolerated and can lead to disciplinary action;
- it is more likely to enhance performance and achievement which will allow all members of our University community to fully utilise their skills and talents and achieve their full potential.

In  addition,  the  University  wants  to  create  a  climate  of  trust  through  the  provision  of  a  transparent oversight process, to include external membership, and to take a proactive approach to monitoring and publication of statistics and identification of actions to address any patterns of inappropriate behaviour that is arising.

This policy sets out how the University defines bullying and harassment, what it expects of members of the UCD student and employee community, the responsibilities of key roles in the University and how you will be supported when issues of this nature occur.

We [University College Dublin] recognise that bullying and harassment - in either a learning or work environment - can cause not only personal distress, but also a loss of confidence, low morale and illness.  It  can  also  lead  to  absenteeism  from  course  work  or  the  workplace  and  interfere  with  your academic performance and work. You have the right to disclose experiences of unacceptable behaviour while studying or working, to be listened to, to seek support and to have the issue resolved.

We encourage you to come forward to seek support and assistance in resolving any issues of bullying or harassment, and to explore informal and formal options available for resolution. You can  be  assured  that  we  will  act  sensitively  to  all  cases  of  bullying  and  harassment.  All individuals involved in a bullying and harassment situation will be supported. We will ensure that, in all cases, reports are carefully and thoughtfully addressed through a process that is transparent  and  clearly  communicated  to  all  individuals  involved  in  line  with  personal  data requirements.

## 2. Scope

This Policy applies to all members of our community and others as defined below under section 3. Those under the category of 'other' (as defined under section 3) can avail of this policy if they wish to report  or  make  a  formal  complaint  of  bullying  and/or  harassment  against  a  member  of  the  UCD community. If there is any issue in relation to the conduct of those under the category of 'other', then the policy of the organisation in which they are employed or connected to will normally apply. However, UCD  reserves  the  right  to  carry  out  an  investigation  under  this  policy  taking  into  account  the circumstances of the case. The support services of UCD are applicable to UCD Community members.

This Policy applies to all areas of University operations and programmes.  It includes conduct which takes place:

- On our campus
- Other places where our employees or students or others are representing the University or are engaged in a University connected activity.
- At events such as social functions, conferences, sporting events, field trips or work assignments which are related to the University or are a University connected activity.
- In relation to clubs/societies
- At  non-UCD  connected  activities,  on  or  off  campus,  including  social  gatherings  involving  UCD students and employees, or other members of the UCD community as defined below, where the alleged incident(s) has a direct impact on the individuals where there is ongoing interaction between the individuals in a University related environment.
- This conduct can be in person, in writing, on the telephone, by e-mail or on the internet and social media.

## Students on Internship/Placements

- Where  UCD  students  on  placement  or  internships  in  other  organisations  wish  to  make  a complaint of bullying and/or harassment against an individual in that organisation, the dignity and respect policies of that organisation will normally apply.
- Where a UCD student on placement or internship in other organisations has a complaint made against them, they will be subject to UCD policy and they may be subject to the policy of that organisation also.
- Where a UCD student on placement or internship in another organisation makes a complaint against another UCD student on placement/internship in that organisation, they will be subject to UCD policy and they may be subject to the policy of that organisation also.

- In some situations, based on the circumstances of the case, UCD and the host organisation may need to agree on who should lead the investigation process.

## Employees on Secondment

- Where a UCD employee is on secondment in another organisations and wishes to make a complaint of bullying and/or harassment against an individual in that organisation, the dignity and respect policies of that organisation will normally apply.
- Where a UCD employee on secondment in another organisation has a complaint made against them,  they  will  be  subject  to  UCD  policy  and  they  may  be  subject  to  the  policy  of  that organisation also.
- Where a UCD employee on secondment in another organisation makes a complaint against another UCD employee also on secondment in that organisation, they will be subject to UCD policy and they may be subject to the policy of that organisation also.
- In some situations, based on the circumstances of the case, UCD and the host organisation may need to agree on who should lead the investigation process.

There will be no time limit regarding receipt of complaints by the University.  The focus will not be on the length of time to bring the complaint forward but rather the impact of the delay on the likelihood of a  fair  investigation  being  carried  out.   The  impact  of  the  delay  will  need  to  be  determined  by  the Screening Panel based on the information they receive as part of the formal complaint and they will consider the following:

- The circumstances of the alleged complaint
- The complexity of the alleged complaint
- The cause of the delay
- Possibility of prejudice to the respondent.

If  the  Screening Panel  confirms, based  on the  information they have received as part of the formal complaint, that impact of the delay will not impinge on the likelihood of a fair investigation, an external investigator may be appointed.  The external investigator, based on the information received as part of the investigation, can recommend that by reason of the passage of time and taking into account the considerations referred to above, a fair investigation will not be possible.

In the event of the death of a respondent, an investigation will not proceed.

It is possible for an individual to feel they have also been subjected to sexual misconduct. If this is the case, please refer also to the policy on Sexual Misconduct.

## 3. Definitions

It is important that you make yourself aware of the definitions below as it will help determine whether the policy applies to your own situation. It will also make you aware of the type of behaviour that is not acceptable and which you should not engage in. These definitions have been developed based on a review of best practice, Codes of Practice, extensive consultation and relevant legislation. The fact that the  person  who  caused  the  offence  may  not  have  intended  to  engage  in  bullying  or  harassment behaviour is not a defence, it is the impact of the behaviour on you that is considered. It is important to note that whilst some behaviours may not fall under the definitions as outlined below, the University does not tolerate unacceptable behaviour of any type. Please refer to Section 6(a) below on Related Documents for information on other related policies.

## UCD Community

- All UCD employees, whether part time or full time, permanent or temporary;
- All UCD employees of  based in overseas campus/offices;
- All students of UCD;
- Those engaged in Club activity such as graduates (player, committee member, coach/manager), those volunteering to coach/lead/manage, those being employed by the club to coach/ lead/ manage ;
- Non-University employees who use University funds, facilities or other resources, including the University's name and reputation, to carry out teaching and/or research, and/or participate in UCD-administered  research,  including  retired  employees,  visiting  faculty  and  researchers; consultants,  contractors,  affiliated  hospital  staff,  industrial  personnel  and  research  fellows, regardless of obligations to other companies or institutions; and
- All persons conducting teaching and/or research at or under the auspices of UCD including at any  of  UCD's  overseas  campus,  including  visiting  faculty  and  researchers;  consultants; contractors, Emeritus or adjunct appointments; and research fellows.

## Other

In this Policy, 'others' shall be taken to include, but is not limited to:

- contractors, and sub-contractors;
- alumni and past employees;
- vendors;
- those who engage and/or who interact with the University and/or its associated bodies;
- those who provide services to the University;

## Bullying

Bullying is defined as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work/study and/or in the course of employment/study which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity at the place of work/study.  An isolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition may be an affront to dignity at work but, as a once off incident, is not considered to be bullying.

The University will apply the following criteria set out by the Code of Practice on Bullying 2021:

- an on-going series of accumulation of seriously negative targeted behaviours against a person or persons to undermine their esteem and standing in a harmful, sustained way
- behaviour is offensive, on-going, targeted and outside any reasonable 'norm'
- a pattern and trend are involved so that a reasonable person would regard such behaviour as clearly wrong, undermining and humiliating.
- involves  repeated incidents or  a pattern  of  behaviour  that  is  usually  intended  to  intimidate, offend, degrade or humiliate a particular person or group of people - but the intention is not important in the identification process.

However, unacceptable behaviour is not tolerated and you should refer to the Grievance Procedure or the Student Code of Conduct to resolve an isolated incident.

The following are common, but not exclusive examples of bullying behaviour:

- Verbal abuse/insults
- Physical abuse
- Being treated less favourably than colleagues
- Intrusion - pestering, spying or stalking
- Unjustifiable exclusion e.g. withholding information, isolation or non-co-operation, nonresponse or repeated unavailability, exclusion from classroom and social activities.
- Menacing behaviour
- Offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, open aggression, threats, shouting.
- Undermining behaviour
- Controlling, coercive and threatening behaviour
- Excessive monitoring of work
- Humiliation
- Gossip
- Withholding work-related information
- Blame for things beyond the person's control
- Misuse of power through means intended to undermine, humiliate, denigrate or injure the recipient.
- Bullying and Harassment on Social Media whether conducted on a personal device or University equipment.

Bullying  at  work  does  not  include  reasonable  and  essential  feedback  or  constructive  criticism  or discipline  arising  from  the  management  of  the  conduct  or  performance  of  an  employee  at  work  or actions  taken  which  can  be  justified  on  grounds  such  as  safety,  health  and  welfare  at  work.    For example, an employee whose performance is justifiably signalled in a proper and reasonable manner as being below required standards may feel threatened and insecure in their work but this in itself does not indicate bullying.  In addition, differences of opinion, arguments or other interpersonal conflict can occur  in  the  workplace,  classroom,  in  student  clubs,  teams  and  in  student  societies.    Bullying  or harassment should not be confused with these situations.

## Harassment

Harassment is defined as any form of unwanted conduct related to any of the discriminatory grounds under the Employment Equality Acts which has the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.  Harassment can be a one-off incident. The Formal Investigation Procedures outline a range of informal options and the formal process for resolving issues of a harassment nature. The discriminatory grounds in UCD include:

- Age: a person's age, this does not apply to a person aged under 16. Children are covered by Child Protection legislation and the University's Child Protection Policy.
- Civil status: a  person's civil status be it single, married, separated, divorced, widowed, civil partnered and formerly civil partnered
- Disability: includes  people  with  physical,  intellectual,  learning,  cognitive  or  emotional disabilities and a range of medical conditions
- Family status: being a parent of a person under 18 years or the resident primary carer or parent of a person with a disability
- Gender (including gender identity): a person's gender identity including male, female, other
- Membership of the Traveller community: now recognised as an ethnic group
- Race: includes race, skin colour, nationality or ethnic origin
- Religion: a person's religious belief, background, outlook or none
- Sexual orientation: a  person's  sexual  orientation  including  gay,  lesbian,  bisexual  and heterosexual

- Socio-economic status: a combined economic and sociological measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's economic and social position in relation to others, based on income, education, and occupation.

The following are examples of harassment:

- Verbal harassment - jokes, comments, ridicule or songs
- Written harassment - including text messages, emails or notices
- Physical harassment - jostling, shoving or any form of assault
- Intimidatory harassment - gestures, posturing or threatening poses
- Visual displays such as posters, emblems or badges which may be deemed as harassment
- Inappropriate scrutiny of the activities of others
- Isolation or exclusion from social activities
- Unreasonably changing a person's job content or targets
- Pressure to behave in a manner that the person thinks is inappropriate
- Cyber-harassment whether conducted on a personal device or company equipment.

## Informal Resolution

Informal  resolution  refers  to  the  options  available  to  resolve  an  issue  without  instigating  the  formal investigation  procedure.  These  options  are  outlined  in  the  Dignity  and  Respect  -  Bullying  and Harassment Supports and Guidance document. These options include contacting the person being reported if you feel comfortable doing so or asking the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor to meet with the individual on your behalf, engaging in facilitation or mediation. You are advised to discuss options for resolution with the Dignity and Respect Support Service Support Advisor.  As a person reported, you are also advised to seek advice from a member of the Dignity and Respect Support Service around informal interventions to be aware as to what is entailed.

As set out in the WRC/HAS Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying (2021) (hereafter called the Code of Practice on Bullying 2021), a prompt and informal  problem-solving  approach  offers  the  best  potential  for  addressing  allegations  of  bullying effectively.  It  is  good  practice  that  all  informal  resolution  avenues  should  be  considered and where appropriate, exhausted before a formal process is instigated. Proceeding to a formal process should not be viewed as automatic as set out in the Code of Practice on Bullying 2021 and it is important that parties are aware of the emphasis placed on informal options as a means of resolution. An important reason for this is to support the professional relationship going forward. Further advice can be provided by the Dignity and Respect Support Service. It is recognised that there may be instances where informal options may not be appropriate.

The support and guidance documentation outlines further informal approaches  and  processes that should be considered in addressing and resolving allegations of bullying effectively.

## Reporting Person

A reporting person is defined as an individual that has come forward to report an incident(s) that they consider to be bullying and/or harassment type behaviour, however they have not submitted a formal complaint form.

## Person being Reported

A person being reported is defined as the individual that the reporting person considers to be carrying out  the  bullying  and/or  harassment  type  behaviour,  however  no  formal  complaint  form  has  been submitted.

## Formal Complaint

A complaint is deemed to be formal once the Dignity and Respect complaint form has been completed and submitted to the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Unit.  Following receipt of a formal complaint, a preliminary screening will be undertaken by a screening panel to decide on a prima facie basis whether the alleged behaviour falls within the definition of bullying and/or harassment and scope as defined in this policy.  The screening panel can also recommend if informal interventions should be considered.  If deemed to fall within the definitions and scope and informal interventions are deemed inappropriate by the screening panel, the complaint will proceed to a formal investigation which will be supported by either UCD HR or the Students Engagement, Conduct, Complaints and Appeals office, as appropriate. If  informal  interventions  are  deemed  appropriate  by  the  screening  panel  and  considered  the  most effective means of resolving the issues as per the WRC/HAS Code of Practice on Bullying 2021, a member of the  EDI Unit will meet with both the complainant and respondent separately to discuss these  options  further  and  the  reasons  for  recommending  informal  options  in  this  instance.  If  the Screening Panel finds that the behaviour does not fall within the definitions and scope of bullying or harassment, the panel may direct the complaint to an alternative process. Consideration will be given to the fact that a formal complaint form has already been completed in relation to the issues. Further details in relation to formal complaints and the role of the Screening Panel are located in the Formal Complaints Procedure document.

## Complainant

The complainant is a person who makes a formal complaint, using the Dignity and Respect complaint form, that they have been subject to bullying and/or harassment .

## Respondent

The respondent is a person who is named in a formal complaint as having allegedly carried out the bullying and/or harassment behaviour.

## Precautionary Measures

If  a  person  makes  a  formal  complaint  of  bullying  and/or  harassment,  reasonable  precautionary measures may be put in place pending the outcome of a University or criminal investigation process. A precautionary measure is not a penalty or a sanction and does not indicate that it has been concluded that the person concerned has committed a breach of discipline or a criminal offence. Rather these precautionary measures may be put in place in the best interests of all parties involved including any witnesses.

There are two instances where precautionary measures may be put in place in relation to informal resolution. If an individual reports an issue that has not progressed to a formal complaint and is exploring informal resolution options, precautionary measures may be considered (excluding neutral suspension). An appropriate person in the local structures independent of the situation will determine if precautionary measures  are  required.  Further  information  on  precautionary  measures  can  be  obtained  from  the Dignity and Respect Support Service. If a formal complaint has been made and the Screening Panel recommends informal options, precautionary measures may also be considered. (Further information on the range of measures in this instance are outlined in the formal Complaints Procedures document). As per the Code, enough time needs to be allowed for the informal option process to be successful and behaviour change to be realistically achieved over the longer term.

Precautionary measures may potentially be kept in place following an intervention depending on the circumstances.

## Discrimination

The Employment Equality Acts 1998 - 2015 defines discrimination as treating one person in a less favourable way than another person based on any of the equality grounds (see grounds listed under harassment).  These  include  recruitment  and  promotion;  equal  pay;  working  conditions;  training  or experience; dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment. Claims of discrimination (other than harassment and sexual harassment) are managed under the Grievance Procedure for employees or Student Complaints (or other) for students.

## Victimisation

No person should be the subject of any act or omission that affects them to their detriment for having raised bullying and/or harassment issues, making a formal complaint in good faith, for giving evidence in an investigation (as a witness/bystander for example) or by giving notice of intention to do so.  The University takes victimisation very seriously and action will be taken in instances where this occurs. Any individual  that  experiences  victimisation  is  strongly  encouraged  to  seek  support  and  report  this behaviour to the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor or EDI Unit.

## Penalisation

The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 (the '2005 Act') prohibits employers from penalising employees for making complaints in respect of health and safety matters in the workplace. Penalisation under the 2005 Act is defined as any act or omission of an employer which affects a term or condition of employment of an employee to their detriment. Penalisation could include suspending, demoting, dismissing an employee or reducing their wages. It could also include coercion or intimidation.

## Restorative Practice

Restorative Practice in the context of this policy refers to the potential opportunity, following a formal investigation or informal intervention, for you as a person who has been impacted by another individual's actions or behaviour to discuss this impact with that individual and then collectively to work to identify ways to repair the working relationship or relationship between students. The focus is not on punishment or on the bullying and harassment issues but providing an opportunity for you and the other individual to discuss the impact of the behaviour and ultimately help to restore the professional relationship. In summary it covers aspects such as the issues that occurred, how these have impacted and how things can be made better.

## Dignity and Respect Environmental Assessment

A  Dignity  and  Respect Environmental  Assessment  is  an  assessment  of  the  broader  cultural issues/prevailing conditions within an area. A periodic environmental assessment may be undertaken at  intervals  as  directed  by  a  sub-group  of  the  Dignity  and  Respect  Oversight  group  where  a  small number of areas (Colleges/VP areas) will be randomly selected by the sub-group.

A targeted Dignity and Respect Environmental Assessment may also occur where particular statistical trends have been highlighted. These trends may be identified through anonymous reports made by individuals (reporting person) in the  1 Report and Support Tool for example or where an individual(s) have come forward informally to report an incident but do(es) not wish to make a formal complaint at that point in time. Trends may also be identified where bystanders/witnesses have reported incidents.

1 Report and Support provides the opportunity for you to make the University aware of incidents that you have either experienced or witnessed by reporting them anonymously. More information can be found at reportandsupport.ucd.ie

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

These assessments will help measure how well this policy is being embedded across the University and its impact.

The  Dignity  and  Respect  Oversight  Sub-Group  will  monitor  this  data  on  a  quarterly  basis.  If  an environmental assessment of an area is identified, either on a periodic review basis or arising from a targeted review of data available, the area must cooperate with the assessment. All environmental assessments will be conducted by an independent third party.  A Dignity and Respect Environmental Assessment will not result in any sanctions being issued, however it gives the University the authority to implement action plans aimed at changing culture or behaviours.

The framework for these assessments is currently under development through a sectoral project sponsored by the Irish Universities Association. It is still in the pilot phase and has not yet been rolled out in the sector. This policy will be updated once the framework is available .

## Malicious Complaint

Under the Code of Code of Practice on Bullying 2021, a malicious complaint can be described as an allegation  being  made  without  foundation,  and  with  malicious  intent,  where  a  person  knowingly  or without regard to whether it is true or not, accuses another person of allegedly bullying them. This could also  apply  to  where  one  person  maliciously  complains  of  someone  allegedly  bullying  a  third  party, without fully exploring the veracity of the claim. A malicious complaint has the power to disrupt another person's life  to  a  significant  extent  and  the  potential  damage  should  not  be  underestimated.  Being accused of bullying can have a serious impact on any person and reduce their reputation in the eyes of others, even if later shown to not have been proven. Those making complaints - and those involved in early assessment of the circumstances of a complaint - should always be mindful of the context and situational aspects of the event and accept the different perspectives and points of view different people bring to the same event. Making a malicious complaint, if proven, can have serious implications for the employment / studies of the person making such a complaint and this includes disciplinary action, where established

## 4. Principles

The key principles of the policy are to:

- Ensure that the University has proactive measures in place to promote a positive culture of dignity and respect and to create a working and learning environment which makes clear the expectations  of  members  of  our  community  with  regard  to  respecting  each  other  and  that unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated.
- Create a safe and respectful environment where people feel encouraged to come forward with the issues they are experiencing and have trust and confidence in the process that the issues will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.
- Ensure that there is a range of trained supports available, both voluntary and full-time dedicated roles, whom you can approach and seek support and guidance from and that these are widely communicated.
- Ensure that there are a range of informal and formal options for resolution available for those experiencing issues of a bullying and harassment nature and to promote informal options as the most effective means of dispute resolution as per the Code of Practice on Bullying 2021 where appropriate.
- Promote understanding of our definitions of bullying and harassment.
- Expectation that you will cooperate with all efforts in order to resolve complaints under the policy and without undue delay as appropriate.

- Expectation that you will respect the confidentiality of the process.  However, you are strongly encouraged to seek support from the support services available and your family which will involve you sharing information confidentially with them.
- Enhance transparency by having external expert involvement at key stages of the dignity and respect process including external membership on the screening panel, the appointment of external  investigators,  the  use  of  external  mediators  and  external  membership  on  the  EDI Dignity and Respect Oversight Sub-Group.
- Have  an  effective  and  transparent  monitoring  and  analysis  process  of  dignity  and  respect related data, and the reporting of this data to relevant internal and external bodies on a defined periodic basis in order to demonstrate accountability.

Review this Policy on a regular basis in line with changes in the law, relevant case-law, feedback from people's experience of the policy or other developments.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

As members of our community, we are all expected to work to develop and maintain a high degree of respect in our diverse community and to participate in creating a positive and safe environment.  As with all policies and procedures, this document assigns responsibilities to a range of roles within the University,  including  senior  management  of  the  University.  Failure  to  uphold  the  responsibilities assigned is taken very seriously and may lead to informal or formal action, including, in the case of students, under the Student Code and Student Discipline Procedure, and in the case of employees under the Disciplinary Statute (Statute 28). Formal sanctions available for breach of university policies and procedures are graduated by reference to the seriousness of the breach, for students ranging between a written reprimand to permanent expulsion from the University, and for employees at all levels ranging between a verbal warning to dismissal.

## Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors

Reporting to Equality Diversity and Inclusion, the full-time roles of Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors  will  work  proactively  with  employees  and  students  who  disclose  issues  of  a  bullying  and harassment nature  and  those  who  are  reported.  These  roles,  who  are  experienced  and  trained  to support, respond and advise on all reports of a dignity and respect nature, will provide you with  a supportive, confidential environment in which to discuss the issues and support you to make a decision that is right for you and your situation.

As a reporting person, these roles will provide support and work with you in relation to the steps to seeking a solution to the issues you are experiencing. This includes supporting you through any informal interventions you wish to use, including accompanying you to meetings with the individual if you wish to approach them or potentially engaging with the other individual depending on the circumstances. They can also assist you in making a formal complaint if you wish to do so and continue providing that support  throughout  the  formal  complaints  process  which  may  include  accompanying  you  to investigation  meetings  and  the  provision  of  aftercare  support  following  any  informal  or  formal interventions.

As a person being reported, the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors are also available to support you if you have been accused of carrying out such behaviour however different advisors will

support the various people involved to avoid a conflict of interest. They will provide details to you on the informal options available or if a formal complaint has been made, they will provide information as to what this will normally entail. They may accompany you to investigations and also provide aftercare support.

The Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors will also support, and work closely with, the panel of Dignity and Respect Contact Persons, who are trained voluntary support roles available to those experiencing issues of a dignity and respect nature. Further information on these roles are available in the Support and Guidance document.

The Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor roles are available during normal working hours, however in the case of emergency the Duty Manager in Estate Services is available at any time day or night on 716 7999 and has a direct contact with the Gardaí (Police) if required.

The key responsibilities of the roles include:

- Providing impartial information and support around options in relation to resolving issues of a bullying and harassment nature.
- Supporting  engagement  in  informal  interventions  if  there  is  a  desire  to  do  so  including  the provision of information on mediation and liaising with the external mediation provider in the event that mediation is proceeding.

## People Managers (Heads of School/Unit and those with line management responsibilities) (for employees)

People managers have important roles to play in creating a culture of dignity and respect in their School/Unit and supporting employees who are experiencing issues of dignity and respect, with support from HR. There may be instances where an individual may feel that there is a conflict of interest in approaching their line managers where the issue is with the line manager or if both individuals involved report to the same manager. In this instance, individuals can approach the next management level up or contact the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor as well as seek support from the other sources of support available. The role of the People Manager is to:

- At all times, treat all members of the University community with dignity and respect.
- Proactively promote ongoing awareness in relation to dignity and respect in their area including keeping dignity and respect as a regular agenda item at School/Unit meetings.
- Work with those involved in a bullying and harassment issue in a proactive manner to provide options and potential pathways for resolution of issues in a positive, solution focused manner. Seek advice from HR and the Dignity and Respect Report Support Service Advisors as well as engaging with other people managers to seek support and advice (anonymously) in relation to addressing issues of dignity and respect in their areas.
- Undertake appropriate training and be able to explain the policy and the supports to employees in their area.

- Encourage employees to come forward to report issues and to encourage them to seek support and guidance from the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors and other supports that can assist in the resolution of issues.
- Monitor and follow up on the situation to ensure that unwelcome behaviour does not occur or recur.
- Be vigilant for signs of bullying and harassment through observation and by getting feedback and to take appropriate action before a matter escalates.
- Where unwelcome behaviour has occurred, and is admitted, be clear that it is not acceptable and to take disciplinary action if appropriate.
- Work with HR to take precautionary measures as deemed reasonable by the University.
- Facilitate and/or pro-actively request environmental assessments in their area and encourage participation  by  students  and  employees,  ensuring  that  they  are  supported  throughout  the process.

## (b)  Legislation

This Policy is designed to ensure compliance with the Codes of Practice issued under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (as amended) and the Employment Equality Act (as amended) and the provisions of the Work Relations Commission (WRC) S.I. 208/2012 for addressing harassment/sexual harassment.

- Equal Status Acts, 2000 - 2018
- Prohibition to Incitement of Hatred Act 1989

- Industrial  Relations  Act  1990  (Code  of  Practice  for  Employers  and  Employees  on  the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work Order 2020) (SI no 674 of 2020)

This  Policy  has  also  been  developed  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  Student  Code  and  the  IUA Guidelines 2020.

## (c)  Confidentiality (see Data Privacy statement)

Confidentiality will be observed as far as practicable and in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection  Act  2003  -  2018  and  the  Children  First  Act,  2015  which  governs  child  protection. Confidentiality is a key principle of the Dignity and Respect - Bullying and Harassment policy and is essential to the integrity of a formal complaints process. It is important that any party to a complaint, which most commonly includes reporting person/complainant, person being reported/respondent or witness, does not breach confidentiality. This does not preclude parties to the complaint from accessing confidential support services such as Employee Assistance Service, speaking to a designated contact person or a student advisor, trade union representative, accompanying person or  human

resources. Respect  for  an  individual's  request  for  confidentiality  will  be  maintained  (as  far  as practicable) except in any or all of the following situations:

- In situations where there is a risk that a Respondent may repeat their actions and pose a real physical/mental threat to the well-being of others. If this situation arises, the HR Director or the Registrar, as appropriate, must be contacted and there will be full disclosure to them
- Where failure to disclose information may be a breach of statute
- Where an individual is a minor
- Where there is a potential risk to the University
- Where failure to disclose information may be a breach of Funding Agency Terms &amp; Conditions.

The University will take action that is necessary and proportionate in order to protect the right of the reporting  person/  complainant,  person  being  reported/  respondent  or  witness  involved  in  an investigation.

## d) Investigations by An Garda Síochána (Police) / Court orders

- I. Where an employee/student identifies a breach of this policy which constitutes a criminal offence  or  an  immediate  threat  to  safety,  they  should  report  the  matter  to  the  Gardaí. Individuals should also inform the University through their line manager or the Dignity and Respect  Support  Service  Advisor,  so  that  appropriate  steps  can  be  taken  and  support provided.  Employees  or  students  can  contact  the  Gardaí  directly  or  through  the  Duty Manager in Estate Services who has access to a contact point in Donnybrook Garda Station at any time, day or night. The Duty manager can be contacted on 716 7999.

The University  will  only  in  the  most  exceptional  circumstances,  and  with  the  benefit  of specific legal advice, report a complaint to the Gardaí contrary to the wishes of the reporting person/complainant. The circumstance in which a report by a University may be justified is if  there  is  considered  to  be  a  clear  and  imminent  risk  to  the  safety  of  the  reporting person/complainant or of third parties. If the University does decide that it is necessary to report the allegation to the Gardaí, then the reasons for taking that action will be explained to the reporting person/complainant so that they understand what is happening and they can be prepared if/when the Gardaí contact them. Further details are located in the Dignity and Respect Formal Investigation Procedures.

- II. If any individual has a court order against a UCD community member, they should provide a copy of this to the Dignity and Respect Support and Report Advisor. When the University is put on notice of a court order it will take all reasonable steps to facilitate compliance with the  order  where  possible.  Enforcement  of  the  order  is  however  a  matter  for  the applicant/court.

## e) The  Children's  First  Act  2015  and  Criminal Justice  (Withholding  of  Information  on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012

The  University  is  obliged  to  report  any  disclosures  of  child  sexual  abuse,  assault,  illtreatment, or neglect of children to Tusla under the reporting responsibilities of the Children First Act 2015, the 2017 Guidance, the University's Child Safeguarding Statement and the principles of natural justice. Any person to whom such a report is made should contact the UCD Child Protection Officer.  The University also has a reporting obligation under the Criminal  Justice  (Withholding  of  Information  on  Offences  Against  Children  and Vulnerable  Persons)  Act  2012. The  Act  creates  a  criminal  offence  of  withholding

information relating to the commission of a serious offence, including a sexual offence, against a person under 18 years or a vulnerable person.

## f) Transparency through Monitoring and Reporting

We are committed to being transparent in relation to issues of bullying and harassment in the University whilst still protecting anonymity.  Data relating to complaints and reports of bullying and harassment will be used to inform the development of initiatives and activities designed to prevent such behaviour, enhance supports for those experiencing bullying and harassment and promote a safe and respectful environment for all.

A report including an analysis of data collated in relation to contacts, reports, formal complaints and anonymous reports via the University's anonymous Report and Support system and, where appropriate, relevant recommendations will be submitted to the University Management Team and EDI Group on a quarterly basis and annually to the Governing Authority. Data will also be made available to the Dignity and Respect Oversight sub-group through a data collection system that will be established to enable the group to identify areas for targeted environmental assessments.

Specifically, the report will include:

- Statistical data relating to contact, reports, anonymous reports and formal complaints made under the Dignity and Respect - Bullying and Harassment Policy received each year.
- The number of formal complaints investigations and the number of formal complaints that led to disciplinary action.
- Contacts made with the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors.
- An analysis of the data collated and any relevant recommendations.
- Summary of progress against the Framework for Consent in HEIs action plans
- Summary of progress against the overall Dignity and Respect Implementation Plan
- Outline of planned actions and initiatives.

For the purpose of continuous monitoring and to enable local review, quarterly reports will be produced and disseminated to senior university leaders. Data will also be made available to relevant University stakeholder groups.

The University will also report dignity and respect statistical data to the HEA as appropriate.

## g) Data Protection

The University has published data privacy statements for employees and students which explain how personal data is used. A specific Data Privacy statement has been developed for this policy which explains how the University will use personal data if one is a reporting person/complainant, person being  reported/respondent  or  a  witness  in  a  case  considered  under  the  policy  and  procedure  for handling cases of bullying and harassment.
