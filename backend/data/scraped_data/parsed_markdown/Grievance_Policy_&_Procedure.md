## 1. Purpose

University College Dublin (UCD) is committed to promoting and maintaining good employee relations and safeguarding the well-being of its employees. As such, this policy is intended to  reflect  the  high  value  the  University  places  on  its  community  and  forms  part  of  the University's industrial relations structures. The University recognises that from time to time difficulties will occur in the normal course of interaction between employees. This is to be expected in any organisation or workplace; UCD fully appreciates the significance of these difficulties and the impact they can have on employees, students and the wider University community.  UCD,  therefore,  endeavours  to  resolve  any  issues  affecting  its  employees quickly, efficiently and in an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence. UCD is committed to  implementing  a  Grievance  Policy  where  the  primary  focus  is  to  bring  about  an  early resolution of employee relations issues and potential grievances.

In most instances, it is intended that issues will be resolved informally between employees and their line manager. In cases where this is not possible, this Grievance Policy, which has been developed in accordance with the Labour Relations Commission's Code of Practice, the Universities Act 1997 and the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures) (Declaration) Order 2000, will apply.

When issues concerning a potential conflict of interest arise and/or where senior employees are  party  to  the  grievance,  the  University  will  endeavour  to  ensure  an  objective  party  of appropriate level of seniority is in place to hear the grievance.

## 2. Definitions

## Grievance

A grievance may be defined as a complaint that an employee has regarding their terms and conditions of employment, working environment or working relationships.

A non-exhaustive list of grievances may include;

- 1) assignment of duties;
- 2) terms and conditions of employment;
- 3) health and safety issues; and/or
- 4) workplace change.

## Grievance Stages

## Informal Stage

Most grievances are capable of being resolved on an informal basis without recourse to the formal grievance process stages listed in the paragraphs below. Where a grievance arises, the parties concerned are encouraged to understand the other party's position and should seek,  as  far  as  possible,  a  mutually  acceptable  solution  through  informal  means.  Where appropriate,  employees  should  in  the  first  instance  raise  the  grievance  informally  and engage  in  respectful  conversation  with  their  manager  to  ascertain  if  a  solution  can  be reached prior to evoking the formal stages of the grievance process.

## Formal Stages

Where  a  grievance  remains  unresolved  following  the  informal  stage  of  the  grievance process,  or  where  a  grievance  raised  is  not  suitable  to  be  dealt  with  informally,  the grievance may be referred to the formal stages of the process listed below.

There are four formal stages of the UCD Grievance Process;

- 1) Formal Stage 1

This is the first step of the formal process of the grievance policy. Typically, where an employee has a grievance, under Stage 1, the employee raises the grievance with their immediate manager.

- 2) Formal Stage 2

If  an  employee's  grievance  cannot  be  resolved  at  Stage  1,  the  grievance  may  be referred to a more senior manager under Stage 2 of the process.

- 3) Formal Stage 3

If  an  employee's  grievance  remains  unresolved  after  Stage  2,  or  if  the  grievance relates to remuneration, the grievance may be referred to UCD HR. As appropriate, an investigator may be appointed to investigate the grievance. If necessary, this may be an external appointee.

- 4) Formal Stage 4

If  having  exhausted  the  internal  resolution  mechanisms  at  Stages  1  to  3,  and  the grievance  remains  unresolved,  a  referral  to  the  Workplace  Relations  Commission may be made by either the employee or the University.

## 3. Scope

This  Grievance  Policy  aims  to  address  promptly,  impartially  and  as  far  as  possible  in  a manner acceptable to all, grievances that do not have a resolution expressly provided for elsewhere within the University.

This Policy applies to all current UCD employees and can be invoked at any time.

Please  note,  in  cases  of  alleged  bullying  and/or  harassment,  including  alleged  sexual harassment, the employee concerned should channel their complaint through the University's  Dignity  and  Respect  Policy.  If  an  employee  wishes  to  make  a  protected disclosure  regarding  a  relevant  alleged  wrongdoing,  the  complainant  should  direct  their complaint through the University's Protected Disclosures Policy. Please note, the University reserves  the  right  to  direct  an  employee  to  policies  and  procedures,  other  than  this Grievance  Policy  and  procedure  document,  where  a  resolution  is  expressly  provided  for elsewhere within the University.
