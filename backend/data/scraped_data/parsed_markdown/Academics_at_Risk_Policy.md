## Academics at Risk Policy

Policy owner:

Equality, Diversity &amp;

Inclusion

## 1. Purpose

Under  UCD's  University  of  Sanctuary  status,  the  University  is  committed  to  creating  an  inclusive environment, offering opportunities for education and fostering a sustainable culture of welcome and inclusion for those seeking sanctuary. As part of its commitments under the University of Sanctuary process, UCD has established a pilot process whereby Academics at Risk (AAR) can engage in teaching, learning or research in UCD.  By arranging temporary academic positions, this process offers safety to scholars facing grave threats so that they can continue working.

The  Sanctuary  Award  is  an  initiative  of University  of  Sanctuary  Ireland (UoSI) to  encourage  and celebrate the good practice of universities, colleges and institutes welcoming refugees, asylum seekers and other migrants into their university communities.

## 2. Definitions

In this context the term 'Academics at Risk' refers to academics and researchers who are suffering grave threats to their lives, liberty and well-being and are seeking temporary research and teaching positions at academic institutions, and who have been identified by the relevant organisation/agency (such as Cara) to the University.

## 3. Scope

The Policy applies to Schools and Colleges wishing to support an Academic at Risk and support units including HR, Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion (EDI), IT Services, Teaching and Learning, UCD Research, UCD Global, UCD Estates and other relevant units/roles who may be involved in providing support.

It applies to Academics at Risk (as defined above). For this pilot phase, the University will support the appointment of two AAR for a period of two years.

## 4. Principles

- To provide opportunities to Academics at Risk to continue their work safely.
- The  University  has  a  responsibility  to  share/use  its  capacity  to  provide  support  to  those Academics at Risk identified by relevant organisations/agencies that operate in this field to enable them to safely engage in their research for an agreed period of time.
