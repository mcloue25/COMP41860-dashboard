Approval date and body

16 April 2020, Academic Council Executive Committee

## 1.  Purpose

- 1.1 The University's expectations regarding student conduct and behaviour are articulated in the UCD Student Code. However, in some circumstances, a concern may arise about a student's behaviour, capacity, welfare or wellbeing to the extent that their fitness to continue in study is a cause for concern. The concern may arise because faculty or staff or others consider that a student's health, behaviour or actions may constitute a risk to the learning, working, or living experience of themselves or others. The  University  has  a  duty  to  ensure  that  a  student  is  fit  to  continue  in  study  while  undertaking education and training.
- 1.2 This policy sets out how the University may respond to instances where a concern is raised regarding a student's fitness to continue in study and the type of action that may be taken to support the student and manage the matter.
- 1.3 The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance about, and to set out procedures for, identifying and supporting students about whom there are fitness to continue in study concerns; and for determining whether a student is fit to continue in study.
- 1.4 The objectives of this policy are to:
- a) Protect the student, staff, faculty, the University, and the public;
- b) Identify and support students whose behaviour, capacity, welfare or wellbeing are of concern to themselves or others, or whose behaviour or actions are impacting adversely on, or pose a risk to, the learning, working, or living experiences of themselves or others;
- c) Guide students who experience issues that may affect their fitness to continue in study;
- d) Provide  a  suitable  framework  for  the  effective,  consistent  and  timely  identification  and management of Fitness to Continue in Study issues that may arise;
- e) Treat  concerns  regarding  student  fitness  to  continue  in  study  seriously  and  as  quickly  as possible.

## 2.  Definitions

## 2.1 Fitness to Continue in Study

A fitness to continue in study concern arises where a student's health, behavior, capacity or actions are impacting adversely on, or pose a risk to, the learning, working or living experiences of themselves or others. A student may be deemed not fit to continue in study where it is considered that:

- a) the student's health, behaviour or actions pose a risk to their own health, safety and/or wellbeing and/or that of others;
- b) the student's  health, behaviour or actions is (or is  at risk of) adversely  affecting the working, learning or living experiences of others;
- c) the student's health or behaviour is (or is at risk of) adversely affecting the day-to-day activities of the University or a placement provider;
- d) the student's support needs fall outside the scope of the support and other services, which the University can reasonably be expected to provide.

Fitness to continue in study concerns can occur at any stage during a student's time at University.

The role of the policy is to establish a university-wide approach for dealing with such issues and facilitate Programmes and Schools in providing students experiencing difficulties with the appropriate supports and opportunities to remedy any problems that they experience. It is important to note that fitness to study issues can arise and be satisfactorily dealt with during a student's programme of study and outcomes of a formal fitness to study procedures reflect a judgement on a particular issue, at a particular moment in time, and is not necessarily intended to be a judgement about a student's fitness to study in the future.

## 2.2 Governing Board

All programmes in the University are overseen by a Governing Board, Graduate Research Board, Board of Studies,  or  Joint Academic  Programme  Board (all hereafter referred to as a Governing Board),  which  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  overall  performance  and  progression  of  students registered to its programmes and ensuring their academic welfare.

## 2.3 Level 1

Level 1 refers to the procedures for an initial response and support at local level. See section 6 for Level 1 procedures.

## 2.4 Level 2

Level 2 refers to the procedures for a Governing Board review. See section 7 for Level 2 procedures.

## 2.5 Return to study

Return to study in the context of this policy refers to the return to the University of students who have been suspended or directed to take a leave of absence under a Fitness to Continue in Study Policy.

## 3. Scope

- 3.1 This  policy  applies  to  all  students  throughout  their  period  of  registration,  and  to  former  students seeking to return to study whose registration has previously been excluded or withdrawn under a Fitness to Continue in Study process.
- 3.2 This policy relates to situations where a student's behaviour, welfare and wellbeing is impacting on their  capacity  to  study.  If  a  student's  eligibility  or  capacity  to  continue  with  their  studies  is  being impacted by:
- a) unsatisfactory academic performance or progress, the University's Continuation and Readmission Policy should be considered by governing boards, as appropriate.
- b) their  failure  to  adhere  to  the  professional  practice  standards  and  requirements  specified  in Programme Fitness to Practise Statements, the University's Student Fitness to Practise Policy and procedure should be considered by governing boards 1 .
- c) their persistent failure to attend or engage with the programme at all, the University's Withdrawal Procedure should be considered by governing boards.
- d) their  poor  conduct,  the  Student  Code  and  the  Student  Disciplinary  Procedure  should  be considered.
- 3.3 At  any  stage  of  these  procedures  a  case  may  be  referred  to  be  considered  under  an  alternative University policy or procedure as appropriate. The Chair of the Governing Board shall decide which policy  should  have  priority  or  be  the  most  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  The  Chair  of  the Governing Board may suspend a policy or procedure, pending the outcome of another policy or procedure.

## 4. Principles

- 4.1 This policy  should  be  interpreted  in  a  manner  that  welcomes  diversity,  respects  the  dignity  of  all persons  involved,  promotes  equal  opportunities  for  students  to  develop  their  full  potential,  and ensures a positive student experience, and that ensures a fair, clear, consistent and timely approach to dealing with Fitness to Continue in Study matters.
- 4.2   In  implementing this policy, staff will consider what support may be offered to students both from within  the  University  and  externally.  Students  will  be  provided  with  information  on  the  range  of supports available and encouraged to seek support.

1  The Student Fitness to Practise Policy applies only to programmes with approved student fitness to practise statements.

- 4.3 The processes under all levels of this policy will be undertaken in a transparent manner, and the student will normally be informed of the identity and capacity of any persons with whom the University consults, including third parties, such as health professionals.
- 4.4 Should a student be unable or unwilling to participate at any level of this policy or to attend a meeting, the University may nonetheless follow this policy where it is reasonable to do so.  The University may deal with issues on the basis of written reports and/or statements in the absence of the student. In addition, the University may consider any request from a student to proceed with a meeting in their absence on the basis of written reports and/or a written statement from the student.
- 4.5  Where an issue arises in relation to  a  student  who  is  known  to  have  a  disability,  and  where  the disability is relevant to the issue, then in the first instance consideration shall be given to the level and  types  of  support  put  in  place  for  the  student  in  conjunction  with  UCD Access  and  Lifelong Learning. In consultation with the student, reasonable accommodation suitable to the needs of the student will be made available where practicable for students with disabilities.
- 4.6   All matters raised under this policy will be handled sensitively and confidentiality will be observed as far as possible.
- 4.7 A student may be accompanied at meetings provided for in this policy by a support person of their choice
- 4.8 The standard of proof applied at every stage of this Policy is the balance of probabilities.
