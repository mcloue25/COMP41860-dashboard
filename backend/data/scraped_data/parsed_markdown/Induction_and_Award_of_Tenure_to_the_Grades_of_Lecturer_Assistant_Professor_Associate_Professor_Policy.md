1. Policy Summary (Revised procedures to govern induction and the award of tenure for the grade of Lecturer/Assistant Professor 1 and Associate Professor 1 ).

These  procedures  have  been  revised  to  take  account  of  the  academic restructuring of September 2005 and changes to the procedures for tenure for Associate  Professor  as  approved  by  the  UCAATP  at  its  meeting  on  15 December  2005.  They  have  been  further  revised  by  UCAATP  at  its  final meeting on 10 th June  2016  to  reflect  new  academic  titles  and  to  revise  the membership of the Tenure Committee.

These  procedures  supersede  all  earlier  procedures  and  will  apply  to  all Lecturers/Assistant  Professors  and  Associate  Professors  appointed  from  1 September 2003.

These  procedures  also  supersede  procedures  put  in place for faculty appointed  after  2012,  as  the  adoption  of  new  procedures  for  academic promotion  and  the  standing  down  of  the  UCAATP  removed  the  need  for UCAATP members to be on the Tenure Committee.

## 2. Purpose of Policy &amp; Definitions

- 2.1.  The University has a vision to secure its position among World leading Universities  for  research  and  teaching  by  continuing  to  attract  top quality Faculty and fostering their development.  Implicit in this is the requirement,  on  the  part  of  the  University,  to  support  and  help  the development  of  Faculty  to  allow  them  to  achieve  high  levels  of performance  in  all  areas  of  their  academic  employment,  especially research, teaching and contribution to the University community.
- 2.2.  It  is  recognised  that  many  new  Faculty  may  require  training  and support in order to develop their research, teaching and administrative skills.  Similarly, the transition to active contribution and engagement with the University community may require both time and support.

## 3. Scope of the Policy

The  probation and  induction processes  outlined in this  document  are designed to assist new Faculty to undertake the transition to UCD in as short a  timeframe  as  possible,  within  a  supportive  and  encouraging  environment. The award of tenure recognises the successful completion of these processes and the attainment of a standard of performance and engagement consistent with full academic privileges.

## 4. Policy &amp; Procedures

## Induction Period

- 4.1 An induction period of 3 years will normally apply to all permanent Lecturer/Assistant Professor appointments.  The first year of the induction period will run concurrently with the probationary period.
- 4.2 T he full induction period may be waived in the case of Lecturers/Assistant Professors  who  have  a  doctorate  and  substantial,  relevant  academic experience,  and  are  deemed  by  the  Head  of  School  and  College Principal to satisfy the requirements for tenure at an earlier point in the induction period.
- 4.3 In such circumstances, a decision to waive part of the induction period at the point of initial appointment may be made by the College Principal on the  recommendation of the Assessment Board.  UCD HR  Promotions, Grading and Reward will report all such cases to the Tenure Committee for information.
- 4.4 Faculty  appointed  as  Associate  Professor will not be  required to complete an induction period. On  successful completion of the probationary period, tenure will automatically be awarded and UCD HR Promotions,  Grading  and  Reward  will  notify  the  individual/s  and  the Tenure Committee, at its next meeting.
- 4.5 The  induction  process  is  the  shared  responsibility  of  the  individual Lecturer/Assistant Professor and the Head of School, in collaboration, as required, with other members of the School.  It is designed to assist the Lecturer/Assistant Professor to satisfy the requirements for the award of tenure and to develop a career path that may, in time, lead to promotion to  Associate  Professor,  Professor  or  Full  Professor.    It  is  a  phase  of supported development during which Lecturers/Assistant Professors  are usually  assigned  lighter  administrative  and  teaching  duties  than  is  the norm for their School and are encouraged and guided to develop their capabilities  across the three core aspects of their role as academics  i.e.,  research  and  scholarship,  teaching  and  learning  and  contribution. During the induction period Lecturers/Assistant Professors will be given feedback on a regular basis on their performance in each of these areas, at  meetings  with  the  Head  of  School,  or  another  senior  colleague nominated by the Head of School. This will provide the Lecturer/Assistant Professor with the opportunity to address any

necessary performance improvements as they arise.  A written record of the feedback meetings will be maintained.

- 4.6 A decision to waive part of the induction period at any point after initial appointment may be made by the Tenure Committee on the recommendation of the College Principal and Head of School.

## Tenure

- 4.7 The attainment of tenure is an important step in the professional life of all  Faculty.    The  benefits  of  tenure  include  the  right  to  enjoy  the  full protection  of  the  Universities  Act,  1997  in  relation  to  terms  and conditions  of  employment,  to  be  a  voting  member  of  the  College  to which  their  School  is  affiliated,  and  to  be  a  member  of  their  School Committee.
-  All new Lecturers/Assistant Professors can expect to be awarded tenure during the final year of their induction period provided that they meet the agreed tenure requirements.
-  All new Associate Professors can expect to be awarded tenure on satisfactory completion of the probation period.
- 4.8 Tenure is awarded by Academic Council on the recommendation of the Tenure  Committee,  which  acts  upon  the  advice  of  Schools/Colleges. The membership of the Tenure Committee is as follows:
-  President or their nominee(ex officio);
-  Registrar (ex officio);
-  Six College Principals;
-  Two nominated Union representatives (IFUT x 1 and SIPTU x1);
-  Up  to  four  additional  tenured  Faculty  may  be  co-opted  on  the recommendation  of  the  President,  in  the  interests  of  achieving greater gender representation.

A  three  year  term  will  apply  in  the  case  of  the  Union  representatives,  and members co-opted on the recommendation of the President.

## 4.9   The role of the Tenure Committee is to:

-  Consider recommendations for tenure made by Heads of School;
-  Consider  recommendations  to  withhold  tenure  made  by  Heads  of School;
-  Provide  advice  and  guidance  to  Heads  of  School  regarding  their role in  managing  the  induction  period  and  ensure  that  such management is properly executed;

-  Review  and  endorse  action  plans  that  have  been  developed  by Heads  of  School  in  collaboration  with  Faculty  who  have  been refused tenure;
-  Consider reports from Heads  of School on the progress of untenured  Faculty  and  monitor  the  progress  of  those  Faculty  to ensure  that  the  action  plan  agreed  between  the  Faculty  member and her/his Head of School is followed;
-  Make recommendations for tenure to Academic Council.
- 4.10  The  Head  of  School  has  a  role  in  encouraging  and  supporting Lecturers/Assistant  Professors  through  the  course  of  their  induction period  to  meet  the  requirements  for  tenure.    The  requirements  for tenure are as follows:
- a) Academic achievement demonstrated by the possession of  a doctoral degree or its recognised equivalent; and
- b) Certification from the Head of School of evidence of :
-  satisfactory performance of lecturing and other teaching duties;
-  satisfactory engagement in research and scholarship evidenced by publication in appropriate journals and/or books by academic publishers and/or postgraduate supervision; and
-  satisfactory involvement in the activities of the School.
- 4.11  In some instances the Tenure Committee may agree:
- a) an  Interim  Pathway  for  tenure  for  particular  groups  of  Faculty  in emerging disciplines and academic areas; or
- b) an Alternate Pathway for particular groups of Faculty in specific predetermined  disciplines  and  academic  areas  where  excellence  in professional practice would replace the requirement for a PhD or its recognised equivalent.

The development of such Pathways will involve discussion with the relevant employee representative unions.

## 5. Application Process

- 5.1 Applications for the Award of Tenure are, normally, considered annually. Lecturers/Assistant  Professors  who  have  satisfactorily  completed  the probation  and  where  appropriate  the  induction  period  may submit  an application to UCD HR Promotions, Grading and Reward comprising:
-  One copy of a completed Application Form

- 5.3 UCD HR Promotions, Grading and Reward will present the applications for tenure and the recommendations from Heads of School to the Tenure Committee for its consideration.
- 5.4 The Tenure Committee will verify that the Head of School's recommendation is fair and sound and will maintain a written record of its deliberations and decisions for the purpose of feedback and review.
- 5.5 If the performance of a Lecturer/Assistant Professor  applying for tenure is found to be unsatisfactory for reasons which are beyond the Lecturer/ Assistant Professor's control,  the Head of School and the University will take whatever action is necessary to remedy the situation to ensure that such reasons will not, at any time in the future, be an impediment to the granting of tenure.
- 5.6 The  list  of  Faculty  recommended  for  Tenure  will  be  forwarded  to  the President.    The  President,  in  accordance  with the Governing Statute shall assign Lecturers/Assistant Professors and Associate Professors  to a School.
- 5.7 The list of Faculty recommended for Tenure will be communicated to the Academic Council.  Having satisfied itself that the Tenure Committee's recommendations  are  sound  and  were  reached  in  a  fair  manner,  the Academic Council  will  approve  the  recommendations,  and  its  decision will be communicated in writing by the Registrar to the Lecturers/Assistant Professors and Associate Professors and the Heads of School.
- 5.8 Lecturers/Assistant Professors who are not recommended for tenure by their Head of School will have a right of appeal to the Tenure Committee. Appeals must be lodged in writing to UCD HR Promotions, Grading and Reward within 20 working days of receipt of advice that an application has been unsuccessful.
