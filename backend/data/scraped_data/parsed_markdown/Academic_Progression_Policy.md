## 1. Purpose

The Academic Progression Policy governs the progression of Lecturer/Assistant Professor Below the Bar (BTB) to Lecturer/Assistant Professor Above the Bar (ATB). The purpose of the policy is to:

- To ensure that individual academic staff continue to develop their scholarly contribution and contribute to the mission of the University in terms of teaching and learning, research activity, and contribution to the School, College, University, and wider community.
- To recognise and further motivate staff who have made and continue to make significant contributions in the three areas detailed above and facilitate their progression to the Lecturer/Assistant Professor ATB Pay scale.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to Lecturer/Assistant Professors BTB both permanent or fixed term who are paid according to the Lecturer/Assistant Professor BTB Pay scale.

## 3. Eligibility

Applicants must be at point 12 of the Lecturer/Assistant Professor BTB Pay scale for a minimum of one year after which progression available.

Applicants placed on points 13 or 14 of the Lecturer/Assistant Professor BTB Pay scale at the time of their initial appointment are also eligible after one year.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

HR Operations will run an increment report to identify Lecturers/Assistant Professors BTB on points 12, 13 or 14 who are due an increment in the next 2 months.

HR Operations will email the relevant Head of School Lecturers confirming progression is due and will be applied on the relevant date. Unless the Head of School raises any objection, progression will be automatically applied.
