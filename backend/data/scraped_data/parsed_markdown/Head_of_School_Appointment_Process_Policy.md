## Head of School Appointment Process Policy

Policy owner(s)

UCD Human Resources, University Secretariat

## 1. Purpose

The  purpose  of  the  policy  is  to  outline  the  practical  steps  which  should  be  taken,  subject  to  the jurisdiction of the Statute, for the nomination of an individual to act as Head of School.

## 2. Principles

The  Statutory  basis  for  the  appointment  of  Heads  of  School  in  UCD  is  to  be  found  in  Governing Statute (32), Section 17. The Statute envisages five broad stages in the process as follows:

1. Consultation by the College Principal within the relevant School to achieve consensus, where possible, in identifying a recommended candidate;
2. Determination  by  the  College  Principal,  following  this  consultation,  of  whether  or  not  an advertised (internal and/or external) process should be undertaken;
3. Recommendation to the President by the College Principal of a suitable candidate emerging from either (1) or (2) above;
4. Consultation by the President with the Academic Council with regard to the recommendation emerging from (3) above;
5. Appointment by the President.

In addition, careful consideration needs to be given to a new appointment and their induction and this is dealt with as Stage 6 (below).

Academics  promoted  or  appointed  to  the  level  of  Professor  are  expected  both  to  have  the  set  of experience and skills required to be Head of School, and to be willing to serve the University and their School  by  taking  on  this  role.  In  normal  circumstances,  the  Head  of  School  will  be  selected  from amongst the Professoriate.

Appointment to the Headship of a School shall normally be for five years, but the President may make appointments  for  terms  of  different  duration  provided  such  appointments  are  not  greater  than  five years. Heads of School shall be eligible for re-appointment.

## ● Stage 1: Consultation

Normally, twelve months prior to the formal initiation of the process envisaged by the Statute, it is recommended that the College Principal or their nominee consult with School Faculty and Staff  to  discuss  the  broad  issue  of  succession  planning  in  the  light  of  the  challenges  and opportunities  facing  the  School.  Where  a  nominee  is  appointed  by  the  College Principal to manage  the  consultation  process,  they  will  be  a  member  of  faculty  and  they  will  be

independent  of  the  incumbent  Head  of  School.  At  the  end  of  the  consultation  period,  the nominee will present their findings to the College Principal.

As a result of the consultation process, potential internal candidates should be identified and a  broad  analysis  of  their  strengths  and  opportunities  for  development  undertaken.  At  the discretion  of  the  College  Principal,  a decision should be made as to the level of preliminary consultation they should undertake with any potential candidates identified at this preliminary stage.

It is recommended that the formal elements of the first stage would be handled directly by the College Principal  or  nominee.  Consultation  can  include  the  incumbent  Head  of School, the School  Executive  and  the  opportunity  for  one-to-one  meetings  with  all  members  of  the School.  It  is  proposed  that  these  meetings  would  consider  the  School's  Strategic  Plan  as background  and context to the identification  of  the  key  qualities,  attributes  and  experience required of the Head of School over the coming five year period.

The  consultations  should  try  to  establish,  in  the  first  instance,  as  much  consensus  as possible,  prior  to  the  identification  of  potential  specific  candidates.  The  process  should encourage any appropriate form of feedback to the College Principal or their nominee, either in open meetings or on an individual and confidential basis, from members of staff, including an  invitation  to  propose  names  of  individuals  (including  one's  self)  who  would  match  the desired criteria. The consultation process should also actively probe the views of the School members as to the relative merits of an internal versus an international search and selection process.

## ● Stage 2: Determination by College Principal of an appropriate selection process

Following the data gathered in Stage 1, it will be for the College Principal to form a judgement as to the desirability or not of an advertised selection process. If the Principal is satisfied that the  consultations  undertaken  at  Stage  1  yield  a  clear  consensus  with  regard  to  a  suitable appointee,  then  it  is  open  to  the  Principal  to  recommend  that  individual  to  the  President without  further  process.  It  is  also open to the College Principal to request any other form of event  (for  example,  a seminar to be given to the School) to help them form that judgement. Any other forms of representation made to the College Principal in support of any candidate are valid (but not conclusive) forms of input to the Principal in helping them form the relevant judgement.

If  the  College  Principal  forms  the  view  that  an  advertised  process  should  occur,  then  the normal procedures governing such processes should apply. These include the preparation of a 'person specification', appropriate advertising (internal and/or external),  invitation  of expressions of interest, normal assessment processes (including the possibility of presentations to the School). In general, the assessment panel to be selected for the process should  be  composed  in  the  same  way  as  the  composition  of  a  panel  for  any  analogous appointment. In particular, the provision of Governing Statute (32), Section 17 that 'the School shall be represented on any search, selection or interview panel.' (Part 7) must be applied.

## ● Stage 3: Recommendation to President

The Statute requires the College Principal to make a recommendation of a suitable candidate to  the  President.  This  recommendation  may  emerge  either from Stage 1 or Stage 2 above. While the Statute is  silent  on  the  situation  which  would result from the failure to identify an appointable  candidate  from  Stage  2, it seems clear that its intention is to afford the College Principal the discretion to  engage  in  whatever  form  of  search  process  is  considered

necessary  or  to  repeat  the  consultation  process  with  whatever  modified  criteria  appear reasonable.

## ● Stages 4 and 5: Academic Council and President Approval

The appointment is made by the President, following consultation with the Academic Council. It should be noted that the Statute makes provision, in Governing Statute (32), Section 17 'in special circumstances', for the appointment by the President of any candidate to the role for a period  'not  exceeding  twelve  months  as  the  Governing  Authority  may  determine.'  In  this scenario,  the  President  must  inform  the  Academic  Council  of  his  decision.  This  confers discretion  on  the  President  for  an  appointment  for  a  lesser  period  than  the  norm.  For  the avoidance  of  doubt,  it  is  proposed  that  the  President  would  seek  the  approval  of  the Governing Authority for the period of the appointment.

## ● Stage 6: Handover Phase and Induction

Once  announced,  the  appointee  should  commence  a  handover  from  the current  Head of School under a mentoring arrangement. The College Principal should also be involved in this process to ensure the alignment of the School with the overall strategy of the College. UCD HR should be involved in drawing up the guidelines for this period.

It  is  strongly  recommended  that  the  newly  appointed  Head  attend  the  Head  of  School Induction programme - normally conducted in early September.

During  the  handover  period,  the  successor  should  also  be  encouraged  to  attend  any additional relevant courses which will support them in the Head of School. Further information can  be  sought  from  the  People  and  Organisation  Development  section  of  UCD  HR  or  the UCD People and Organisation Development website.
