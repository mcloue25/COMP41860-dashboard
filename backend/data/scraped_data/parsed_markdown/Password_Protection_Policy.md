## Password Protection Policy

<!-- image -->

Policy owner:

IT Services

Approval date and body: August 2024 - UMT

## 1. Purpose

Passwords are the most common form of authentication used to control access to information and are an important part of University College Dublin's (UCD) efforts to protect its technology systems and information assets. This policy is designed to address password weaknesses by establishing a standard for creation of strong passwords, the protection of those passwords, and the frequency of change. Passwords are widely used because they are simple, inexpensive, and convenient mechanisms to use and implement access control. At the same time UCD acknowledges that passwords are recognized as a poor form of protection for access control on their own. For some higher-risk systems or for those with access to personal data or confidential university information, other approved authentication methods that provide higher levels of trust and accountability must be used where available.

## This policy sets out University standards for:

- The creation of strong passwords
- The frequency of change and reuse of those passwords
- The protection of those passwords

## 2. Definitions

A 'strong' password is one which has the following characteristics:

- Password is unique.
- Contains at least 10 alphanumeric characters.
- Password must include at least one letter.
- Includes at least two of the following characteristics
1. Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.
2. Contains at least one number (for example, 0-9).
3. Contains at least one symbol or special character (for example !$%^&amp;*()\_+|~-=\?&lt;&gt;.)

## A 'weak' password is one which has the following characteristics:

- Contains less than 10 characters
- The password has been used elsewhere on a UCD or non-UCD application.
- Can be found in a dictionary, including foreign language, or exist in language slang, dialect, or jargon.
- Has been discovered in a data breach commonly known as a broken password.

- Contains personal information such as birth dates, addresses, sports teams, phone numbers, or names of family members, pets, friends, and fantasy characters.
- Contains work-related information such as building names, system commands, sites, companies, hardware or software.
- Contains a number, letter or keyboard pattern such as aaabbb, qwerty, zyxwvuts, or 123321.
- Contains common words spelled backward or preceded or followed by a number (for example, terces, secret1 or 1secret).
- Is some version of 'Welcome123' 'Password123' 'Changeme123' 'L3tm31n'

## Personal Data consists of:

- Any information concerning or relating to a living person who is either identified or identifiable. An individual could be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (such as an IP address) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that individual.

## Confidential University Information consists of:

- Information which, if disclosed, deleted, altered or made publicly available could cause damage or distress to individuals, damage commercial or financial interests of the University and its connected companies, or result in the loss of intellectual property of the University or those connected to it.

## 3. Scope

All members of UCD's student, faculty and staff population as well as all contractors and temporary staff who have or are responsible for an account (or any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides on the University network, has access to the University network, stores any non-public University information or has been authorised as a University service including but not limited to public and private cloud services.

## 4. Principles

## 4.1 Password creation

- All user-level and system-level passwords, including privileged accounts, must conform to standards of a 'strong' password.
- All user-level and system-level passwords, including privileged accounts, must not have any of the characteristics of a 'weak' password.
- University passwords must be unique to University systems. Users must use a separate password for all non-University systems, for example use a different password for websites and applications (including mobile apps) such as LinkedIn, Facebook, social media sites and applications, online shopping accounts, online personal memberships and so on.
- Where possible, user accounts that have system-level privileges or administration privileges must use a unique password from all other accounts held by that user.

## 4.2 Password change

- All passwords must be changed if there is thought to be risk to UCD data because:
- The password does not conform to standards of a 'strong' password.
- There is suspicion that an account has been compromised.
- All passwords including system level passwords should be changed at regular intervals, ideally at least every 12 months.
