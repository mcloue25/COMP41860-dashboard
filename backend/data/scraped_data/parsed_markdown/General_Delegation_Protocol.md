## 1. Purpose

The  General  Delegation  Protocol  authorises  relevant  faculty  and  staff  (President,  Vice-Presidents, College  Principals,  Heads  of  School  and  Unit,  Head  of  Research  Institutes)  to  delegate  approval authority as appropriate to other employees  of the University in relation to operational policies/processes approved by UMT.  The intention of the General Delegation Protocol is to ensure the  efficient  operation  of  the  University  by  streamlining  decision  making,  implementing  controls through appropriate approvals and delegation, and building levels of trust and personal responsibility throughout the University.

Approval authority is provided to individuals based on their position or function within the University. Within each College, School, Research Institute or Unit, the College Principal, Vice-President, Head of School, Head of Research Institute or Head of Unit is responsible for the overall operations of their area and may delegate approval authority to appropriate employees in compliance with this protocol.

## 2. Supporting Principles

- The General Delegation Protocol applies only to those policies of the University which have been approved by UMT.  It does not apply to policies approved by Governing Authority or Academic Council.
- The Protocol allows the delegator (i.e. President, College Principal, Vice-President, Head of School,  Head  of  Research  Institute  or  Head  of  Unit)  to  delegate  approval  authority  to appropriate  employees of the University (delegatees).    Overall  responsibility  for  decisions remain with the delegator.  The delegator shall implement and maintain appropriate internal controls and remains accountable for all actions taken by their delegatees.
