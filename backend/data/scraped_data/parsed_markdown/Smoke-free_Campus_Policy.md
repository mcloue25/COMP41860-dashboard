## Smoke-Free Campus Policy

Policy owner

## 1. Purpose

UCD is committed to having campuses where all community members can go about their business in an environment unencumbered by smoke or vapour from tobacco or e-cigarettes. This commitment applies to the built-up areas of the campuses, car parks and pedestrian routes to and from commuting facilities. It is the policy of University College Dublin that defined areas of its campuses are smoke-free and that smoking and vaping/e-smoking in all forms is prohibited in these areas.

## 2. Definitions

Campuses refers to the Belfield and Blackrock and Lyons Farm campuses.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, students, service users, customers and visitors. This policy coexists with the UCD Smoke-Free Workplace policy.

## 4. Principles

The key principles behind a smoke-free campus include:

- The establishment of smoke and vapour free areas as a courtesy to campus users
- The protection of the UCD environment from litter
- The promotion of good health amongst the university community

The policy was implemented in 3 phases starting in September 2015. Implementation is now complete.

To facilitate campus community members to go about their business in an environment unencumbered by smoke or vapour from tobacco or e-cigarettes, no smoking/vaping is permitted in:

- the core built-up areas of the Belfield, Blackrock and Lyons Farm campuses
- the campus commuting hubs, car parks and pedestrian routes to and from commuting facilities on the Belfield, Blackrock and Lyons Farm campuses
