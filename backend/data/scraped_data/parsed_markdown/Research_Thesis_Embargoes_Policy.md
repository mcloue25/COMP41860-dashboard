## Introduction

A digital copy of a UCD research thesis is automatically deposited in the Research Repository UCD (RRU) upon Academic Council Committee on Examinations (ACCE) award of the research degree and, without an embargo being set, is immediately publicly available to view. An embargo is only relevant to the digital copy of the thesis deposited in the RRU. It is a requirement for the award of a research degree that a printed copy of the thesis is also deposited in UCD Library to be archived in closed store 1 .

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to clearly articulate the University position on restricting access to a research thesis submitted to the University RRU upon award of a research degree, why an embargo may need to be put in place and the procedure to do so.

## 2. Definitions

Thesis: A thesis is the final document, containing the context, nature, methodology and the outcomes of the research, that is submitted by a student to the University for examination in support of their candidature for a doctoral or research master's degree.

eThesis Examination System: The eThesis examination system is a secure electronic University system through which students are required to submit their thesis for examination. It also captures the final examination report, which contains the outcome and recommendation in relation to the thesis examination. All reports are passed on to the ACCE, who in their capacity as the Examination Board and awarder of research degrees for the University, determine the outcome of the examination and whether a research degree can be awarded.

Research Repository UCD (RRU) is a digital collection of open access scholarly research publications from University College Dublin. The repository collects, preserves and makes freely available publications including peer-reviewed articles, working papers and conference papers created by UCD researchers. When a research degree is awarded by the university, a hardcopy of the research thesis upon which the award is based, is archived in UCD Belfield Campus. A digital

Thesis Embargo: A thesis embargo will delay the release of a thesis to the RRU for a specific period. Once embargoed, only the title and the abstract of a thesis will appear in the RRU. The full text of the thesis will become available for public view when the embargo period expires.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all research degree theses that are submitted to UCD for examination and are the basis of the award of a research degree. Minor research theses which contribute to a taught Master's degree or undergraduate degree are not in the scope of this policy.

## 4. Principles

1. Open Access: UCD is a signatory to the National Principles for Open Access and all research degree theses completed at the university are expected to be made publicly available as soon as possible following the award of a degree. This allows the University to demonstrate the quality of its research and the rigour of its research degree programmes. Therefore, the default position of the university is to not place an embargo on a research thesis.

- steps need to be taken to ensure compliance with it. Such steps may include placing the thesis under embargo.
5. Rapid Takedown Option: The rights owner of copyrighted material included in a research thesis may request that UCD Library remove the thesis from open access. In such cases the thesis will be taken down immediately and the request investigated. If the request is found to be legitimate, and not protected by the principles of 'fair dealing', the material will be withdrawn permanently from public view, although its bibliographic details will be retained in the RRU.
6. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: Thesis Embargo policy and procedure will, in so far as is possible, take into account the University's strategic commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion. UCD provides a positive working, research and learning environment. which is open to all regardless of age, disability, gender, marriage or civil partnership, race (including ethnic or national origin, nationality, or colour), religion or belief, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the travelling community, or socio-economic status.
