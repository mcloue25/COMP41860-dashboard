## 1. Purpose

The University is committed to providing an environment in which all members of our community should expect to be able to thrive and to be respected and valued for their unique perspectives and contributions so that they can achieve their fullest potential. The University recognises that a positive study and work environment can have an important impact on student and employee well-being and lead to better performance, improved retention, and contribute to a healthy University. Our University is committed to the promotion of a culture where everyone is respected and free from conflict but it also recognises that conflict can occur, and the University aims to support all members of the University community to work together to resolve conflicts such as interpersonal difficulties.

Where interpersonal difficulties occur, the University promotes and encourages early resolution of issues through informal means in so far as is possible. Mediation is one means of resolving issues informally, once efforts at resolution have taken place at local level, and is proven to be an effective tool for resolving conflicts between individuals at work and study.

## 2. Definitions

Mediation can be defined as a voluntary, confidential process that allows two or more disputing parties to resolve their conflict in a mutually agreeable way with the help of a neutral third party, a mediator.

Examples of such disputes include:

- Interpersonal differences, conflicts, difficulties in working/studying together

- Breakdown in a working relationship for employees or students
- Where it is felt bullying or harassment has taken place

Mediation is most effective when:

- Both parties are willing to work together to resolve their differences
- Room exists for an improvement in working relationships
- Attempts at resolution have already occurred at local level where appropriate so that parties are aware of the issues going into mediation
- There is a dispute over a workplace situation or in a study context
- No breaches of legislation or incidents of physical abuse have occurred (such matters should be dealt with under the University's Disciplinary Policy, Student Code of Conduct or other relevant policy)

## 3. Principles

The key principles of this policy are to:

- Provide individuals or groups with a framework for resolving interpersonal conflicts in a way which is impartial and objective.
- Resolve interpersonal conflict at the earliest possible opportunity through informal means.
- Allow individuals the opportunity to engage in a voluntary, confidential and non-binding process.
- Allow the individuals the space and opportunity to initiate their own solutions to the issues thereby increasing the likelihood of a successful and long-lasting outcome.
- Support the 6 values of the University; Excellence, Integrity, Collegiality, Engagement, Diversity and Creativity.
- Create a positive working and learning environment which supports good communication amongst leaders, people managers, colleagues and students, and makes clear the expectations of our community with regard to mutual respect.
- Promote awareness of steps which individuals may take if they have interpersonal difficulties.
- Preserve the professional relationship between students and employees and help restore it where it has broken down.
- Have an effective monitoring and analysis process that supports the policy.

## 4. Scope

This policy applies to all employees and students in UCD. In limited circumstances, the policy may apply to other UCD community members. Mediation is mainly used to help resolve issues between two parties but can also be of value in helping to restore a professional relationship following another process.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

The mediation service offered by the Workplace Relations Commission is an alternative to the UCD Mediation Service. It affords employees appropriate access to its mediation service in circumstances where assistance is sought in respect of claims of infringements to employment rights. It also provides access to the general public in respect of claims involving unequal treatment and discrimination claims in the civil and public service. This form of mediation seeks to arrive at a solution through an agreement between the parties, rather than through an investigation or hearing or formal decision where a formal complaint has been lodged with the WRC for Adjudication. It is important to note that the agreement reached through mediation following a formal complaint at the WRC is legally binding and can be enforced through the Courts. Further information on the WRC Mediation Service can be found at the Workplace Relations Commission website http://www.workplacerelations.ie/en/.
