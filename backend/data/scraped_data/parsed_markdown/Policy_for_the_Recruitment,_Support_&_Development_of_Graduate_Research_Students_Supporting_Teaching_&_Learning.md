<!-- image -->

| Policy Owner   | UCD Graduate Studies   | Approval Date: 30 th May 2025 Body: Academic Council Version: 2.0   |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 1.  Introduction

UCD students are invaluable contributors to education at the University, supporting learning in both graduate and undergraduate programmes. Training in teaching support provides students with an opportunity to enhance their professional development and Teaching and Learning (T&amp;L) experience. This policy outlines the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders in the provision of teaching support at the University.

The availability of teaching and teaching-related activities will be driven by the academic needs of the graduate and undergraduate community and will be determined by individual Schools. Therefore, the amount of teaching support activities such as tutoring and demonstration will vary from year to year and there is no guarantee of teaching and teaching-related opportunities being available to all students every year.

## 2.  Purpose

This policy outlines the expected standards to be applied with respect to recruitment, support and development of students participating in teaching support activities. Furthermore, the policy will ensure equality and consistency across the university in the management of teaching support from students.

## 3. Definitions

Teaching Support: Activities include tutoring, demonstrating, fieldwork, marking of essays, marking of scripts, grading School in-trimester assessments/examinations for undergraduate and graduate taught students. Activities also include supporting in-school accommodations for students with additional needs for assessment.

Module Coordinator: The Module Coordinator is the individual appointed by, and accountable to, the Head of School or Chair of the Board of Studies to oversee the design, delivery, assessment and grading of a module. The Module Coordinator also acts as the Principal Examiner of that module, a function that cannot be delegated.

Tutor/Demonstrator School Coordinator(s): Staff in the School with responsibility for allocating teaching support hours, oversight of contract management and approval of hourly-paid submissions.

Postgraduate Demonstrator: Research degree student who meets School Postgraduate Demonstrator eligibility criteria.

Senior Postgraduate Demonstrator : Research degree student  who meets School Senior Postgraduate Demonstrator eligibility criteria.

Undergraduate Demonstrator: Senior undergraduate student demonstrating to undergraduate students.

Tutor : Student who provides small group teaching.

## 4.  Scope

The policy will apply to all students registered to the University who undertake teaching support activities in the University.

The following are not covered by this policy:

1. Occasional lecturing since this is not deemed teaching support.
2. Invigilating the end of trimester University exams, this activity is managed by the UCD Registry, Assessment Unit.

## 5. Principles

1. All students receive full financial compensation for all teaching support activities they undertake, preparation time for teaching support and any mandatory time spent in preparatory training.

The availability of, or requirement to, undertake teaching-related activities will be driven by the academic needs of the graduate and undergraduate community and will be determined by the School. The maximum teaching support that a School can mandate for a graduate research student is 150 hours per year including contact and non-contact hours. A school cannot mandate for an undergraduate student to provide teaching support.

3. Recruitment of students to teaching support activities will not discriminate against students on the basis of gender, age, race, disability, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, civil status, family status, or membership of the travelling community. 1
4. Engagement in teaching support activities provides the opportunity for  students to develop broad professional skills, For research degree students, this is under the National Framework for Doctoral Education 2 .

5. Teaching support activities must not detract from a student's main goal of completing their programme of study and/or research within the prescribed period of time.

## 6.  Recruitment

The engagement of students for teaching support activities takes place at School and module level. It is the responsibility of the Head of School (or their nominee) to ensure that the selection process is fair and transparent, and standards of best practice are adhered to when selecting students for teaching support activities. It is essential that any student engaged on this basis has the necessary level of skills and experience to carry out the required teaching support activities.

Students can apply for demonstrating/tutoring duties through their School website as advertised or directly with the person in the School with responsibility for management of tutor/ demonstrator hours allocation.

## 7.  Payment

All students who provide teaching support must be set up as an Hourly Paid Employee. Students can set themselves up using UCD's Online Service Portal and they must complete this process before they can submit any claims for teaching support activities completed.

All information on set-up can be found here:

https://www.ucd.ie/hr/pay/hourlypaidemployees/hourlypaidsetup/

Tutors and demonstrators will be paid at the standard university hourly rates for Postgraduate Demonstrator, Senior Postgraduate Demonstrator, Tutor and Undergraduate Student Demonstrator 3 . Standard rates for essays marked and questions scripts marked also apply.

The School should set norms for preparation time for teaching support, if relevant, and clearly communicate this to students in advance of embarking on the teaching support activities. Where relevant, preparation time calculation is normally between 30 min and 60 min per session for tutoring or demonstrating periods for first time tutors/demonstrators.

## 8.Support &amp; Development

Contribution to teaching support develops a student's teaching and dissemination skills which in turn enhances their career readiness and employability. This is a training role offered to students to gain experience, therefore the University makes such training available to students as a priority, where available.

Schools can provide support for new demonstrators and tutors with a discipline specific module. In addition, the University Teaching &amp; Learning Unit provide a 5 credit module 'Introduction to University Teaching and Learning for Tutors (and Demonstrators)' (UTL40230) 4 .The aim of this module is to enable those who are responsible for supporting teaching in UCD, to reflect, review and enhance their teaching, learning and assessment practices. Participants are introduced to the
