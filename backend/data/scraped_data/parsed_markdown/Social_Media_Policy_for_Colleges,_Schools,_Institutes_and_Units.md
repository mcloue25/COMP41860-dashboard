## Social Media Policy for Colleges, Schools, Institutes and Units

Policy owner:

External Communication Unit

Approval date and body

## 1.  Purpose

As powerful channels of two-way communication, social media provides the university with unique opportunities and benefits in terms of reaching its audiences to build awareness of its activities, and to encourage its audiences to actively engage with and support the university to achieve its mission.

The use of social media as part of the operations of the university also poses potential risks to the reputation of the organisation and its employees.

The decentralised nature of social media channel management across the university means that individual colleges, schools, institutes and units set up and manage their own social media channels and directly publish content to their channels at a local level.

This requires the university to have a policy in place which sets out the standards for the management of such official institutional social media accounts.

This social media policy has been developed to ensure the appropriate use of official institutional social media accounts as part of the operations of the university.

## 2.  Scope

The scope of this policy is limited to employees who manage and publish to official institutional social media accounts of colleges, schools, institutes and units of the university.

This policy does not in any way intend to impact on academic freedom which is protected under Section 14 of the University's Act 1997 as follows:

<!-- image -->

'A member of the academic staff of a university shall have the freedom, within the law, in his or her teaching, research and any other activities either in or outside the university, to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions and shall not be disadvantaged, or subject to less favourable treatment by the university, for the exercise of that freedom."
