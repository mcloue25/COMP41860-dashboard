## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy document is to provide clear guidance on the appointment, role and responsibilities of Extern Examiners 1 for Taught Programmes at University College Dublin (UCD, hereafter, 'the University' 2 ).

The University is responsible for the academic standards of awards made in its name, and for ensuring that the quality of learning experiences is adequate and appropriate to enable students to achieve these standards. In order to discharge these responsibilities, the University has a range of systems and procedures for assuring and enhancing the academic standards of awards and the quality of its educational provision. Extern Examination is one of these.

This document is to be read in conjunction with University Academic Regulations.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to the external examination of the University's taught provision. External examination arrangements for Graduate Research Programmes are described in separate regulatory and guidance documentation.

## 3. Definitions

## 3.1 Extern Examiners for Taught Programmes

Extern Examiners play a vital role in assisting the University in fulfilling its obligations to assure the academic standards and integrity of its awards and form part of the University's broader system of quality assurance and enhancement. Extern Examiners provide an important consultative and advisory function in supporting the development of the subjects and programmes within UCD as well as the enhancement of teaching, learning and assessment practices. While Extern Examiners do not  grade students' work, the title 'Extern Examiner' is retained here due to common international usage of this title for the role defined herein.

Extern Examiners are appointed to subjects or programmes at undergraduate or graduate level, as appropriate. Each subject on the University's subject register shall have an extern examiner. Some subjects may require more than one Subject Examiner while some Subject Extern Examiners may be given responsibility for more than one subject.

## 3.2 Subject

A Subject is that which appears on the register of approved subjects, as maintained, and reviewed by Academic Council.

## 3.3 Programme

A Programme is an approved course of study as defined in University Academic Regulations.

## 4. Principles

The key principles that underpin the role of the Extern Examiner are:

- a) Academic Expertise - The Extern Examiner should have the necessary academic expertise and international standing to evaluate the subject to which they are appointed and its constituent modules at all applicable levels.
- b) Quality - The fundamental role of the Extern Examiner is to assure academic standards and the quality of teaching, learning, assessment and feedback. The Extern Examiner confirms that the academic standards are comparable to those achieved in equivalent universities internationally. Due regard should be given for professional requirements where necessary.
- c) Equity - The Extern Examiner helps to ensure that the assessment practices at the University  are fair, valid and rigorous.

1 The term 'Extern Examiner' is used throughout the document, reflecting the language used by the National  University of Ireland and referenced in Governing Statute, Chapter 7, Section 3, wherein distinction is made between Intern and Extern examiners

2 UCD is a constituent university of the National University of Ireland (NUI).

- d) Enhancement - Extern Examiners provide feedback on the quality of subjects and programmes, the overall student experience, and on how teaching, learning, assessment and feedback may be enhanced.
- e) Objectivity - Extern Examiners provide objective feedback from a position of independence from the University's activities. As such, Extern Examiners will not directly participate in the grading of students' work.
- f) Equality, Diversity and Inclusion - Extern Examiners should support the University's strategic commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion. UCD provides a positive working, research and learning environment which is open to all regardless of age, disability, gender, marriage or civil partnership, race (including ethnic or national origin, nationality or colour), religion or belief, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the travelling community, or socio-economic status. Extern Examiners should, where possible, ensure that this principle is upheld by the assessment processes within their purview.

## 5. The Appointment Procedure

The Academic Council Committee on Examinations (ACCE) is responsible for the approval of all Extern Examiner nominations for the University. The Head of School, in consultation with the Programme Director/Head of Subject, nominates Extern Examiners to the ACCE subject to the following considerations:

- Nominations for new Extern Examiners should be submitted for approval by 1 March of the year of their appointment
- All nominations should specify the subject(s)/programme(s) to which the Extern Examiner is to be appointed.
- Upon approval, the Head of School, Programme Director/Head of Subject and the Extern Examiner will be notified by ACCE.
- Where a nomination increases the overall number of Extern Examiners in a School, the Head of School will provide a rationale for such a proposal to ACCE.
- If the proposed Extern Examiner is from an Irish University, the school is requested to outline in their nomination the reasons for proposing an Examiner from an Irish University.
- The University will forward the approved nominations to the National University of Ireland (NUI) for approval.

## 6. Criteria for the Appointment of Extern Examiners

The appointment of Extern Examiners will be based on the following criteria:

- a) They should have the appropriate academic expertise, experience and, where necessary, professional qualifications relating to the subjects to which they are appointed.
