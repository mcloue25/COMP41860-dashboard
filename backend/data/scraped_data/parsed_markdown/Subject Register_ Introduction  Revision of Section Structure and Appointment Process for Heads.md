In order to appropriately assess the need for establishing Sections, Schools must meet the following criteria:

- Have a critical mass of academic staff. In order to justify a Section a minimum of ten members of Academic staff are necessary.
- Fall into the category of a 'large School'. It is recommended that a School of fewer than 30 full-time Academic staff should not be sub-divided into Sections.
- Currently have complex internal organisation structures within the School.
- Schools must also have completed the following activities:
- o Initial benefits analysis supporting the establishment of Sections.
- o Initial exploratory discussion with their College Principal.
- o Organisation design analysis with the Organisation Development Manager and relevant HR Partner, and other stakeholders as appropriate, e.g. Office of the Registrar.
