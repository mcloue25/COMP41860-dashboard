## 1. Introduction

University College Dublin is a dynamic community of students, scholars and staff committed to performing at the  highest  standards .  The  University's aim is to provide a stimulating and innovative environment for teaching, learning and research. The University wishes to assure quality teaching, learning, research and  service  delivery  through  a  regular  review  and  improvement  process.  Its  approach  to  quality assurance and quality enhancement, as set out in this policy, is to learn from best practice, locally and internationally, and benchmark against leading research universities.

The  aim  of  the  University's  quality  assurance  and  quality  enhancement  policy  is  to  enhance  the effectiveness  of  its  core  activities  of  learning,  teaching,  research,  innovation,  and  their  effective management. This policy also extends to UCD's collaborative and transnational arrangements. The policy  addresses  all  areas  of  University  activity  taking  cognisance  of  their  contribution  to,  and alignment with, the University's Strategic Goals.

UCD is committed to embedding Equality, Diversity and Inclusion across all of its activities in line with University  strategy  and  the Equality,  Diversity  and  Inclusion  Policy 1 .  This  ensures  that  the  entire University community can work and learn in an environment that is inclusive and is defined by dignity and respect. The University recognises that integrating Equality, Diversity and Inclusion into policies and decision-making structures will help achieve a positive teaching and learning experience for staff and students. UCD acknowledges that this will allow it to build on its core values as an institution and continue to deliver a world-class learning experience for students and an inclusive work environment.

## 2. Definitions

As  defined  in the Quality  and  Qualifications  Ireland  (QQI)  Core  Statutory  Quality  Assurance Guidelines (2016),  'Quality  assurance  (QA)  is a term generally used to describe the processes that seek  to ensure  that the learning  environment  (including  teaching  and  research)  reaches  an acceptable  threshold  of  quality.  QA  is  also  used  to  describe  the  enhancement  of  education  and training  provision  and  the  standards  attained  by  learners.' 2 Quality  enhancement  is  the  process  of continuous  improvement.  The  University  operates  an  integrated  system  for  quality  assurance  and enhancement which contributes to the achievement of the University's strategic objectives.

## 3. Scope

The  University  is  responsible  for  the  academic  standards  of  awards  made  in  its  name,  and  for ensuring that  the  quality of learning experiences is adequate and appropriate, to enable students to achieve these standards. In order to discharge those responsibilities,  the University has a range of systems  and  procedures  for  assuring  and  enhancing  the  academic  standards  of  awards  and  the quality of its educational provision. These mechanisms include:

- Regular Peer Review of Academic and Support Units;
- Robust programme approval and curriculum review processes;
- Robust approval, monitoring and review of collaborative taught programme arrangements;
- Module evaluation;
- Extern Examiner Reports;
- Established  procedures  for  the  appointment  of  staff  and  a  comprehensive range of programmes for their ongoing professional development;
- Student  Representation,  e.g.  Student/Staff  Consultative  Committees  or  equivalent; and membership of cross-institutional committees, such as Academic Council Quality Enhancement Committee;
- University Programme Board, Academic Council, and UCD Governing Authority;
- Systematic student participation and feedback in QA/QE processes;
- Regular review of QA/QE processes;
- Compliance  with  national  quality  standards  to  ensure  the  quality  of  education provision  for  all  learners,  including  the  TrustEd  Ireland  Mark  (IEM)  for  international learners.

The University's  implementation  of  its  quality  assurance  and quality enhancement procedures, also enable it to demonstrate how it discharges its responsibilities for assuring the quality and standards of its  awards,  as  required  by  the Qualifications  and  Quality  Assurance  (Education  and  Training)  Act 2012 . 3

## 4. Principles

The UCD Quality Assurance and Quality Enhancement Policy is guided by the following principles:

- 4.1 Quality  teaching,  learning,  research  and  support services, and continuous improvement are core  values.  Quality  assurance  and  continuous  improvement  are understood to be the joint responsibility of staff, management, and the collegial and governance bodies of the University.
- 4.2 Benchmarking  and  evidence  based  approach.  The  University  evaluates  its  achievements against  appropriate  national  and  international  benchmarks.  Its  quality  assurance processes

3 Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012

are  evidence-based, where outcomes and feedback from stakeholders (including students, staff,  employers  and  the  community,  as  appropriate) will provide the basis for analyses and conclusions on which improvements are planned.

- 4.3 Collegiality.  The  University's  processes  reflect  the  principles  of  rigorous peer review, as we aim to identify areas for improvement, to foster collaboration and exchanges of best practice and to encourage an ethos of critical self-evaluation.

The key features of the University's quality assurance and enhancement process are:

- 4.4 A commitment to widespread involvement of staff, students and stakeholders in the quality assurance process;
- 4.4.1 Critical  self-evaluation  and  rigorous  peer  review  of  academic  and  service  areas  by Review  Groups  whose  membership  will  be  diverse  and  include  both  internal University  staff  and  external  members,  all  of  whom  will  be  independent  of  the  unit under review. In the case of an external review of the effectiveness of the institution's quality  assurance/quality  enhancement  processes,  the  Review  Group  membership will  comprise  peer  experts,  and  may  include  a  student expert where relevant, all of whom will be external to UCD;
- 4.4.2 Methodical collection of evidence relating to quality assurance activities, including, as appropriate: service satisfaction  and  student  experience,  benchmarking  against external reference points;
- 4.4.3 External assessment of professional programmes as appropriate, through accreditation and international review;
- 4.4.4 Multiple avenues  for  student  and  staff input  to  quality  assurance  and  quality enhancement  such  as:  Periodic  School  Quality  Review;  Module  Evaluation  and Programme Review;
- 4.4.5 Publish  impartial  and  objective  reports  of  quality  reviews  of  academic  and  service units;
- 4.4.6 Provision of opportunities and support for the continuing professional development of staff.
- 4.5 Robust and accountable University governance, management and decision-making relating to the quality assurance and quality enhancement policy framework.
- 4.5.1 Effective  organisational  structures  to  oversee  quality  assurance  processes  and  the development and implementation of quality improvement plans;
- 4.5.2 A regular cycle of reviews of academic and service providers;
- 4.5.3 A process for monitoring the progress of implementing recommendations arising from Quality Review Reports;
- 4.5.4 A commitment to identify, share and implement examples of good practice, across the University;
- 4.5.5 The University will periodically monitor the effectiveness of its quality assurance and enhancement mechanisms to ensure that they are operating in accordance with best practice.

## 4.6 A commitment to assessing outcomes and processes against the highest external standards

- 4.6.1 Formal links with a number  of  the  world's leading universities; national  and international benchmarking of academic standards and service provision;
