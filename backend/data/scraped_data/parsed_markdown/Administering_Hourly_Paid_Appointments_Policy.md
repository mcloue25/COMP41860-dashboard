Approval date and body

UMT, 1 April 2025

## 1. Purpose

UCD has a significant grouping of hourly paid appointments that are engaged to deliver essential teaching related tasks and to provide administrative support to schools and units across the university.   Hourly paid appointments need to form part of the annual budget planning cycle.

The purpose of this policy is to outline UCD's position with regard to the engagement of Hourly Paid appointments whilst acknowledging the important value that people in these roles bring to the University.

Hourly paid arrangements are allowed for legitimate organisational requirements and specific parameters are required depending on the nature of the work, for example Hourly Paid Administration staff can only be hired on an hourly basis for up to 13 weeks. Legitimate organisational requirement include:

- Cover for temporary absence of another employee, or partial cover e.g.  cover pending the commencement of a new appointee or emergency sick leave cover.
- Cover for defined periods where expertise is not available from within the university in the short-term.
- Work related to one-off events or programmes where specific skills are required on a project or activity basis.
- Work related to unplanned or planned peaks in workload.
- Provision of technical skills or specialist expertise on a short term and irregular basis to supplement the skills and expertise of the salaried staff in the area.
- Provision of industry/professional/practitioner expertise.
- Seasonal short-term work in hospitality, catering, housekeeping or services roles.
- Short-term work related to peaks in the academic cycle such as exams, assessments, graduations, registrations.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all activities in relation to hourly paid appointments employed by UCD. Agency staff do not form part of this policy.

This policy should be consulted by all employees involved in any aspect of engaging with hourly paid appointments.

This policy does not apply to employees over the age of 70 as to ensure compliance with retirement regulations, employees cannot be engaged on an hourly paid basis beyond the age of 70.   An hourly paid employee may seek an exemption to these regulations if they joined  the public sector between 01/04/2004 and 31/12/2012 and have had no break in service to date.  This may allow categorisation as a 'New Entrant' thus removing the requirement for retirement age 70.

There are several categories of hourly paid appointments, each having their own set of rules and procedures. These are:

- Administration Roles
- Tutors and Demonstrators

## 4. Principles

## 5. Terms and Conditions
