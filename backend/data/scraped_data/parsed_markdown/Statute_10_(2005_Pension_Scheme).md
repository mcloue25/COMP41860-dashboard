- (b) Where some but not all of the children of the deceased are at the time of, or at any time after his or her death in the care of a person other than their parent or stepparent,  the  rate  of  that  portion  of  the  children's  pension  which  is  payable  in respect of the children who are in the care of that person may be calculated by reference to the rates specified in paragraph 8.4(a); provided that the amount of children's pension payable in respect of the deceased person shall not exceed onehalf of the rate of the deceased's pension.
- 8.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, where the deceased leaves a spouse and no spouse's pension is granted to him or her under this Scheme, or, if one is so granted to him or her and it ceases to be paid before his or her death, no pension shall be  payable  under  this  Scheme  to  the  children  of  that  spouse  as  respects  any  period comprised within the lifetime  of  the  spouse  or  within  the  time  in  respect  of  which  no spouse's pension is payable, as may be appropriate, unless the University in its absolute discretion directs that such a pension shall be so payable, and in case the University gives a direction under this paragraph it may, if it thinks fit, further direct that paragraph 8.5 shall apply as respects any such period.

## 9. Payment of Pension

Pensions payable under this Scheme shall be paid monthly or weekly in arrears except that where paragraph 6.5 applies in respect of a deceased member, the University may decide that the amount of pension in respect of the month in question may be paid before the expiry of that month.

## 10. Periodic Contributions

- 10.1 The  rate  of  the  contribution  shall  be  one  and  one-half  per  cent  of  the  amount  of  the remuneration from time to time payable to him or her (or where he or she is in receipt of reduced remuneration because of absence from employment, of the amount of the remuneration that would be payable to him or her if he or she were not so absent).
- 10.2 The  contribution  shall  be  paid  in  respect  of  the  period  commencing  on  the  date  of commencement or the date on which he or she becomes a member whichever is the later, and ending when he or she ceases to be a contributing member and at such times and in such

manner as the University may determine.

- 10.3 No contributions shall be payable under this Scheme by a member for any period which does not constitute pensionable service.

## 11. Refund of Contributions

- 11.2 A member who, on ceasing to be a contributing member, has paid periodic contributions for a period in excess of 40 years may have returned to him or her, or, if membership ceases due to death, to his or her legal personal representative, such of those contributions beginning  with  his  or  her  initial  contribution  and  working  forward,  as  is  necessary  to secure  that  the  period  in  respect  of  which  such  contributions  are  paid  by  him  or  her without being returned does not exceed 40 years.
- 11.3 Where any contributions are returned under this paragraph they shall be returned without interest and less an amount equal to any income tax liability of the member in respect of such contributions.
- 11.4 Where periodic contributions are returned in accordance with this paragraph to a person who subsequently becomes a member of this Scheme, he or she shall refund to the University the amount of the periodic contributions so returned to him or her, together with compound interest on that amount at the rate of six per cent per annum, with half-yearly rests from the date of payment to him or her.

- 12.2 Where a person, on becoming a contributing member of this Scheme, had at any time previously  been  a  member  of  this  Scheme  and  had  paid  periodic  contributions  during such period of membership, the period in respect of which he or she paid such periodic contributions  shall  be  excluded  in  determining  the  number  of  relevant  years  under paragraph 13(8) provided -
- (a) no refund of those contributions is, or was, paid, or

- (b) paragraph 11.4 applies.

## 13. Non-periodic Contributions

- 13.1 Where  a  member  was  married  throughout  the  period,  or  for  a  portion  of  the  period, during which this Scheme applied to him or her and he or she ceases to be a contributing member and such cesser is due to -
- (a) death, or
- (b) retirement on pension or resignation with entitlement to a preserved pension,

then, unless the number of relevant years is nil, a contribution under this paragraph shall be payable by way of reduction in the amount of his or her retirement gratuity or death gratuity or preserved lump sum or preserved death gratuity, or in such other manner as the University may require.

- 13.2 A contribution under this paragraph shall be one per cent of the member's pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of relevant years.
- 13.3 Where a contribution under this paragraph is being deducted from a preserved lump sum or preserved death gratuity, the contribution shall be calculated by reference to an amount equal  to  the  member's  pensionable  remuneration  at  date  of  resignation  as  increased  by reference  to  pension  increases  granted  under  paragraph  10  of  the  Main  Scheme  in  the interval between the date of resignation and the date -
- (a) on  which  he  or  she  attains  the  age  at  which  the  pension  would  become payable, in the case of a preserved lump sum, or
- (b) of his or her death, in the case of a preserved death gratuity.
- 13.4 Where, subsequent to the date on which a member ceases to be a contributing member, the pension payable to his or her or to his or her spouse (but not the retirement gratuity, death  gratuity,  preserved  lump  sum  or  preserved  death  gratuity)  falls  to  be  increased because  of  an  increase  in  the  pensionable  service  of  the  member,  the  University  may adjust the amount of the contribution under this paragraph to take account of the increase.
- 13.5 At the discretion of the University and subject to conditions specified by the University, a member may elect to pay, over a period of twelve months beginning on a date specified by  the  University,  being  a  date  not  earlier  than  the  date  of  the  election,  additional contributions equal in each case to the amount of the periodic contributions payable in respect of that period and in case one or more such additional contributions are made, this paragraph shall apply to the person by whom the contribution or contributions is or are made subject to the modification that, in calculating what is the number of relevant years,

that number shall be reduced by one for every contribution made by the person under this paragraph.

- 13.6 Where  a  member,  to  whom  this  paragraph  applies,  gave  service  otherwise  than  as  a member of the University which is pensionable service under paragraph 6.1 of the Main Scheme, any portion of that service during which he or she paid periodic contributions under  a  scheme  similar  to  this  Scheme  may,  provided  those  contributions  were  not refunded to him or her, or having been so refunded have been repaid by him or her with appropriate  compound  interest  applied,  be  excluded  in  determining  the  number  of relevant years under this paragraph.
- 13.7 In this paragraph, "the number of relevant years" means -
- (a) in  the  case  of  a  member  who  being  then  married,  ceases  to  be  a  contributing member,
- (i) if such cesser is caused otherwise than by death or retirement on medical grounds, the number of years of pensionable service which he or she then had,
- (ii) if  such  cesser  is  due  to  death  or  retirement  on  medical  grounds,  the number of years of pensionable service which he or she would have if he or she had served to age 65,

reduced in each case by the number of years if any, for which periodic contributions have been paid by him or her and are not returnable.

- (b) in the case of a member who, being then unmarried, ceases to be a contributing member, the number of years of pensionable service which he or she had on the date of termination of his or her last marriage before such cesser, reduced by the number of years if any, for which periodic contributions have been paid by him or her and are not returnable.
- 13.8 Where a member who is not fully insured is liable for non-periodic contributions and his or her pensionable remuneration includes pensionable allowances he or she will be liable for  a  deduction  of  one  per  cent  of  the  pensionable  allowances  in  respect  of  each  year during which he or she paid periodic contributions up to the date of termination of his or her last marriage before he or she ceased to be a contributing member.
- 13.9 Where a person to whom paragraph 12.1 applies became a former member by retiring on pension, whether on retirement on medical grounds, or otherwise, then the contribution payable under paragraph 13.2 at the termination of his or her final period of contributing membership shall be reduced by the amount of the contributions paid under paragraph 13.2  when  he  or  she  became  a  former  member,  provided  there  was  no  refund  of  that

contribution.

- 13.10 Pensionable service in excess of 40 years shall be left out of account for the purposes of this paragraph.

Where a member or a former member marries and -

- (a) he or she dies within the year beginning on the date of the marriage, and
- (b) there are no children born of the marriage, and

for the purposes of this Scheme the marriage may be regarded by the University as not having  taken  place,  and  in  case  the  marriage  is  so  regarded  all  necessary  adjustments (including,  if  need  be,  repayment  to  the  University  of  the  sums  paid  in  respect  of pensions already granted under this Scheme) shall be made accordingly.
