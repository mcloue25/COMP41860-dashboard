## Shortfall in research funded PhD fees

A number of funding agencies place a ceiling on the level of PhD fees which they will fund, and some limit  their  funding  to  EU  fees  only.  The  University  Management  Team  has  agreed  the  following sequential steps to manage the shortfall in fees.

1. The VPRII will seek to have funding agencies increase the allowable fee within their grant budget policies.
2. Researchers  are  encouraged  to  include  non-EU  student  fees  in  research  proposals  where possible. Where it is not possible to do this then the Researcher should advise their Head of School and College Principal of the potential shortfall at the time of proposal submission.
3. When there is a shortfall in fees the Researcher should generally seek to cover this from any discretionary funding which is available to them and within their control.
4. Where no other source of  funding  is  available  to  the  Researcher  they  should  discuss  the shortfall with their Head of School and College Principal. If approved by the HOS &amp; CP the unfunded shortfall  may  be  charged  to  their  School,  to  a  special  category  of  'Fee  Related Expenditure'. This will not impact on the School's non-pay budget.
5. Only  in  exceptional  circumstances  where  all  other  options  have  been  exhausted  may  the student be asked to cover the shortfall in fees.
