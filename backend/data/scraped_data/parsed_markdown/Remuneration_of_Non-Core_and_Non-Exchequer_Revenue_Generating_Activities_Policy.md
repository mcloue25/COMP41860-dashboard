## Policy on Remuneration of Non-Core and Non-Exchequer Revenue  Generating Activities

## 1. Introduction

This  policy  sets  out  the  University's  policies  and  procedures  for  remuneration  of  work undertaken of  university staff for non-core, non-exchequer revenue generating activities with a  view  to  expanding and sustaining the University's ability to generate additional sources of nonexchequer income.

The policy is underpinned by the following principles:

-  The  primary  duty  of  staff  is  to  their  core  duties  and  commitments  to  the  normal demands of  their role and additional remuneration for this work will not be considered.
-  Remuneration  will  only  be  available  for  activity  that  supports  the  mission  of  the University  and the delivery of its strategy.
-  Deployment of staff to undertake such duties  will only  occur when there is a clearly verifiable  business  case  to  do  so,  as  opposed  to  the  employment  of  net  additional staff to  undertake such duties.
-  The  policy  is  consistent  with  and  aligned  to  guidance  provided  by  the  HEA  in  this regard.  Specifically;
-  the  activities  concerned  should  generate  significant  net  non-Exchequer  revenues for  the University,  taking  into  account  the  costs  related    to the  additional    work taken  on  by  existing University employees, as clearly demonstrated by appropriate financial and other data;
-  monitoring and validation of payment  for activities which are clearly  and verifiably non-  core duties as determined by a rigorously applied workload allocation model;
-  six-monthly reporting to the HEA, the numbers, grades and total payments made to each  staff member.
-  The  work  undertaken  by  staff  covered  by  this  policy  will  not  be  considered  as contributing to assessment for promotion within the University.  The activity is viewed as additional to core duty and the associated remuneration represents the recognition appropriate for the work.

## 2. Governance, Management and Implementation

The  policy  overseeing  Remuneration  of  Non-Core  and  Non-Exchequer  Revenue  Generating Activities is  approved by FRAMC  (the Finance  Remuneration  and  asset  Management Committee of the  Governing  Authority). FRAMC  approves  the  overall  University  budget  and

within this context approves payments associated with the policy.

Oversight  will  be  undertaken  by  University  Management  Currently,  the  UMT  (University Management Team) will be  responsible for reporting as required by the HEA.

Implementation and operation will be overseen by the appropriate Head of Unit/School/College.

## 2.1 Approval Process

'A Workload Planning System can be defined as: a human activity system at the level of the HE (Higher Education) department that carries out aggregate planning to reconcile requirements  and  capacity  in  line  with  strategic  goals  and  in  particular  promotes equitable workload allocation to individuals.' (Burgess, Lewis &amp; Mobbs, 2003) '

The role of an academic in a modern research intensive University is complex and diverse. It is both difficult and inappropriate to proscribe the schedule of academic staff in detail. Rather, internationally,  the  Workload  Model  is  integral  to  the  operational  structure  and  system that underpins the effective and equitable distribution and monitoring of workload within an  academic unit. A  Workload  Model  attempts  to  balance  load  against  capacity  across  the three  main components of the academic role -Research &amp;Scholarship, Teaching and Learning, and Administration  and  Contribution.  Furthermore,  the  transparent  use  of  such  models  can  reassure staff as to the fairness of both the allocation process and outcomes.

## Approval of Workload Allocation Model compliance with the policy

Schools, Colleges and other Units wishing to make payments to university staff under this policy will be required to demonstrate that a rigorously applied workload allocation model is in place and in operation  in  the  unit.  This  workload  model  will  be  consistent  with  the    University's    guidance. Without prejudice to University policy in this regard, the model will, at a minimum;

-  set out clear expectations of teaching, research and contribution consistent with disciplinary norms.
-  allow a clear determination regarding whether a staff member is in full compliance with it and is therefore fulfilling their normal core duties.

The workload model of a School, College or other academic unit will be reviewed by the appropriate College Principal/Vice President who will make a recommendation to UMT on whether the workload model meets the appropriate criteria. UMT has the responsibility for accepting whether a submitted workload model meets the criteria required within the policy.

Schools/Units having workload models which comply with these requirements will be approved to pay staff for non-exchequer revenue generating activities which are non-core as determined by their workload model.

Workload  Models  approved    under  this  policy  do not  require  re-approval.  Any  changes  to the workload model must be identified during the annual approval of payments and where such changes are significant, full review of the approval may be required.

## Annual Approval of Activity

As part of the normal annual staffing and budget planning cycle,  Units wishing to make payments to university  staff  under  this  policy  will  include  details  of  these  payments  in  their  plans. Supporting this proposal the  School/Unit will

-  Delineate and describe the activities in question
-  Set out the basis that demonstrates these activities fall within the remit of this policy.

-  Present financial information that demonstrates that these activities are expected to directly generate significant net non-exchequer revenues for the University.  Activities which do not demonstrate  the  clear  ability  to  generate  significant  non-exchequer  revenues  for  the University will not be approved for payment.
-  Confirm that the workload model remains fully in operation and identify any changes made in its operation
-  Provide information required to meet the reporting requirements outlined in section 2.3

Approval by UMT of the budget will include approval of annual plans of activity within the scope  of this policy.

The  School/Unit  will  report  periodically  through  their  College  Principal/Vice  President  to  The Finance  Office the direct non-exchequer  revenues and costs associated with the non-core activities approved.  This accounting will  be required    to  demonstrate that these  activities generated  significant net  non-exchequer revenues for the University.

## 2.2 Operation within the Unit

The College Principal/Vice President is responsible for ensuring that staffs benefiting from this policy are fully compliant with its terms.

University staff wishing to be  paid under this policy in the  following academic year  will submit an annual  statement of  activities  to  their  Head  of  School/Unit..  This  statement  will  include  details  of their activities in terms of teaching and learning, research and innovation and contribution.

The Head of School/Unit will satisfy him/herself that the staff member in question has complied fully with  their units  workload  policy  in  terms  of  teaching,  research  and  contribution  and  will  forward that annual statement of activities with a recommendation to the appropriate College Principal/Vice President.

No staff member who is not fully and demonstrably in compliance with their School/Unit's workload policy (as approved above (section 2.1) will be entitled to payments under this policy.

Each School/Unit will operate  a rigorous approvals  policy  with regard  to  such payments.  To  make claims,  a  staff  member  must  submit  the  appropriate  claim  form  signed  by  the  relevant  Head  of School/Unit and by the College Principal/Vice President.

The College Principal/Vice President will only sign a claim form where,

- a) the work carried out is certified by the appropriate Head of School/Unit,
- b) the claimant has submitted an annual statement of activities,
- c) the work was approved within the annual plan of activity and budget, and
- d) the College Principal is satisfied that the claimant is fully compliant with their School/Unit's workload policy (as approved above (section 2.1)).

NB. Cognisant of the importance of compliance with public expectations for the sustainability of this policy, no employee subject to this policy will be paid more than the public sector pay cap as determined from time to time by Government.

## 2.3 Six-monthly reporting to the HEA

UMT will be responsible for reporting as required by  the HEA.  Colleges with Schools/Units that are paying staff under this policy are required to complete  a  six  monthly  return  on  activity  providing such details as required by University Management.  This  will include the numbers, grades and total payments made to each staff member. HR/Finance will coordinate the collection and reporting as

required by UMT and the HEA.

This report will be considered and approved by UMT in advance of submission.

Consideration will be given to the commercial sensitivity of the information released in this report and to other issues pertaining to privacy and data protection.
