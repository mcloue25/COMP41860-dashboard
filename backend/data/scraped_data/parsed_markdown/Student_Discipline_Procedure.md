All relevant submissions and evidence will be considered and that decision-makers considering complaints of misconduct shall act without bias.

## 3. Student Discipline Decision-Making

- 3.1 Academic Council and the Registrar have statutory responsibility for regulating student conduct. The Registrar may nominate an appropriate member of staff to regulate student conduct and to act as the University's representative under the Student Discipline Procedure 1 .
- 3.2 Student conduct is also monitored and dealt with by various university staff as necessary for the effective and efficient resolution of student conduct issues.  The following staff members and university bodies hold delegated authority to consider, make decisions and take actions relating to student conduct, within the context of relevant regulations, policies and procedures.
- UCD  School  Academic  Integrity  Committees  may  consider  and  make  decisions  regarding  allegations  of academic misconduct, in accordance with the Academic Integrity Policy.

- The Athletic Union Council (AUC), Student Societies Council and the Students' Union are responsible for regulating the discipline of their members through their constitutions and related procedures.
- 3.3 The University encourages that minor student conduct issues are resolved at the level closest to the relevant parties. Where this is not possible or appropriate, and a student's behaviour is considered to have breached the Student Code of Conduct, or if an alleged breach of any of the above constitutions, codes, rules or agreements is of such gravity or urgency, the matter may be referred, without decision, to be dealt with under the Student Discipline Procedure.
- 3.4  Under  the  Student  Discipline  Procedure  the  Registrar  or  their  nominee  may  make  decisions  regarding  alleged breaches of the Student Code of Conduct in accordance with section 5 of this procedure.

- 3.5 In the event that more than one procedure is applicable, the Registrar or their nominee may decide which process should be followed or take precedence.

## 4. Procedure

## 4.1  Communications

Communications with students will normally be conducted via email using UCD student email addresses. The Student Engagement, Conduct, Complaints and Appeals unit manages the Student Discipline Procedure and operates as a point of contact for the provision of advice regarding all student conduct matters. Contact: student.conduct@ucd.ie

## 4.2  Reporting breaches

Alleged  breaches  of  the  Student  Code  of  Conduct  are  usually  reported  to  the  Registrar  or  their  nominee  using incident reports or referral letters from the relevant local unit or body such as School Academic Integrity Committees, Assessment / Overseas Programme Managers, (in the case of alleged examination hall misconduct), UCD Residences or Estate Services.  In all other cases alleged incidents will normally be reported using a Student Misconduct Incident Report.  Reports  should  be  submitted  to  the  Student  Engagement,  Conduct,  Complaints  and  Appeals  unit  at student.conduct@ucd.ie.

1 The Registrar's nominee is normally the Dean of Students.

## 4.3  Group allegations

Where reports of alleged misconduct involve more than one student the Registrar or their nominee may decide to proceed with a joint student conduct meeting or joint Student Disciplinary Committee hearing. Respondents will be given equal opportunities to respond.

## 4.4  Confidentiality and record management

Records relating to student conduct  cases are treated with confidentiality and  are held separately to the general student record. Breaches of the Student Code of Conduct will not appear on transcripts. Student discipline documents will ordinarily only be used for student discipline case handling and appeal purposes. Where statistical student discipline data is reported to the University it is anonymised.

Access to student discipline case information be limited to those with responsibility for:

- the administration of the Student Discipline Procedure,
- decision-making,
- implementing decisions and student support professionals, where appropriate.

Where relevant, access may be granted to student disciplinary records and/or they may be used in connection with:

- A claim made by the University or defence of a claim against the University, or member(s) of its staff, in a court, tribunal, statutory decision-making body, arbitral or other decision-making forum.
- The determination of any internal claim, grievance or disciplinary process of the University in relation to other student(s) or member(s) of staff.

Confidentiality does not preclude the University from sharing some information regarding decisions with complainants/reporting parties where deemed appropriate.   Any information shared will be in accordance with the principles of natural justice and fairness to the complainant/reporting party and respondent as well as the Student Engagement, Conduct, Complaints and Appeals privacy statement which covers GDPR. Information relating to decisions may also be shared with members of staff where it is necessary for the effective administration of the process, including the implementation of decisions.

## 4.5 Witnesses

Where a respondent student requests the participation of a witness at a Student Disciplinary Hearing, requests must be submitted  as  soon  as  possible  to  enable  appropriate  arrangements  to  be  made  in  advance  of  the  hearing.    It  is recognised that witnesses may be reluctant to participate, and the University reserves the right to put in place such procedures as are re asonable to balance the respondent's right to request the participation of a witness and the rights of the witness. The University may also request the participation of witnesses for the purposes of balance and for the Student Disciplinary Committee to assess evidence. Witnesses are not obligated to participate.

## 4.6  Complaints of Bullying, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct

The University has a separate procedure for investigating complaints of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment, made against staff or students under the UCD Dignity and Respect Policies and procedure. Where an investigator, under the Dignity and Respect complaint procedure, makes a finding that the matters complained of have occurred in whole or in part and the investigator has established that there has been a breach of the Dignity and Respect Policies , the matter will be referred to the Registrar or their nominee to be dealt with under the Student Discipline Procedure.

## 4.7  Criminal proceedings

Where an alleged breach of discipline may, in the reasonable opinion of the University, constitute a criminal offence, the University will respond and act in accordance with law, which may include reporting the suspected offence to An Garda  Síochána.  The  University  may  pause  any  relevant  University  process  pending  the  outcome  of  a  Garda investigation. Disclosures of relevant offences by students will be considered under the University's Relevant Offence Risk Assessment Policy. For students registered to programmes that lead to professional qualifications and/or license to practise the matter may result in a referral to the UCD Student Fitness to Practise Policy and procedures.

## 4.8  Previous breaches

Where a second or subsequent allegation is referred to a Student Disciplinary Committee, a history of previous breaches will not ordinarily be shared with the Committee until after a student has been found to be in breach of the Student Code of Conduct. However, where the second or subsequent allegation of conduct which is denied by the student but is the same or similar misconduct issue to an earlier referral in respect of which the student was

found to be in breach of the Student Code of Conduct, that finding may be shared with the Committee. Information relating to previous breaches will be used to help the Committee determine an appropriate penalty.

If a previous breach resulted in a penalty that was suspended pending the completion of certain conditions and the student is subsequently found to be in breach of the Student Code of Conduct, the suspended penalty will be enforced. Additionally, the committee may decide to extend the suspension and impose further penalties as deemed appropriate and relevant. Where the subsequent breach is very minor in nature and is unrelated to the behaviour associated with the original breach the Registrar or their nominee or a Student Disciplinary Committee may decide not to enforce the suspended penalty.

## 4.9 Support person

Students may choose to be accompanied to a Student Conduct Meeting or a Student Disciplinary Committee Hearing by a person of their choice, such as a Student Adviser, an SU Officer, a friend or relative. Students are required to speak for themselves at meetings; the role of the person accompanying the student is to provide support. The support person may be invited to contribute to the meeting or hearing by the chair. Legal representation will not normally be permitted but may be permitted in cases of a more serious nature.

The Student Disciplinary Committee Hearing is not intended to be an adversarial process. A support person will not normally be a legal representative and it will be at the University's discretion whether such a person shall be permitted to attend. Permission must be sought in advance.

## 4.10 Fitness to Continue in Study

Where a student's reported behaviour or actions are deemed to be impacting adversely on, or pose a risk to the learning, working or living experiences of themselves or others, the Registrar or their nominee may refer the matter to be dealt with under the UCD Fitness to Continue in Study Policy.

## 4.11 Fitness to Practise

Where a student's reported behaviour or actions may also constitute a failure to adhere to a Programme's Fitness to Practise Statement, the Registrar, or their nominee may refer the matter to be dealt with under the UCD Student Fitness to Practise Policy.

## 5. Student Conduct Meeting

- 5.1 Reports of alleged misconduct are reviewed by the Registrar or their nominee, and where the matter warrants it, the Student Discipline Procedure will be initiated.  The student against whom the allegation is made, hereafter the respondent, will be contacted normally through their UCD Connect email and invited to attend a Student Conduct Meeting. Respondents will be advised that they may be accompanied by a  support person of their choice. Failure to respond to the request to attend a meeting by a specified timeline will constitute a breach of the  Student  Code  of  Conduct  and  may  result  in  the  matter  being  referred  directly  to  Student  Disciplinary Committee for adjudication.

The  respondent  will  be  notified  of  the  allegation  against  them.    A  disciplinary  hold  will  be  placed  on  the respondent's record which will prevent students from accessing examination results and from graduating before the disciplinary matter is resolved.  Holds will be removed when the discipline procedure has been completed. A Student Conduct Meeting will be arranged as soon as is practicable.

Student Conduct Meetings are usually held in-person, but students may be facilitated with an online meeting using video conferencing technology, where appropriate and including where the respondent is not resident in Ireland. Where the respondent is not resident in Ireland, they may also request to respond to the allegation in writing and this shall be at the discretion of the Registrar or their nominee.

- 5.2  The purpose of a Student Conduct Meeting is for the Registrar or their nominee to discuss the allegation with the respondent  and  form  an  opinion  regarding  the  seriousness  of  the  case.  The  Registrar  or  their  nominee  will determine whether the case can be concluded at the meeting or whether the matter requires referral to a Student Disciplinary Committee.  A note-taker will be in attendance and a summary record of the meeting and related outcomes will be kept.

- 5.3  At the meeting the respondent will:
- be advised that the meeting is taking place in accordance with the procedures of the Student Code of Conduct and will be asked if they have read it.
- be  advised  of  their  right  and  the  University's  right  to  refer  the  matter  directly  to  a  Student  Disciplinary Committee for adjudication at any stage during the meeting.
- be asked to confirm that they understand the process and state whether they are willing to continue with the meeting. If the respondent is not willing to proceed with the meeting, the meeting will be suspended, and the matter will be referred to a Student Disciplinary Committee.
- be presented with an alleged breach and asked to respond to it.
- 5.4  The  allegation  made  against  the  respondent  will  be  outlined  and  they  will  be  asked  to  accept  or  reject  the allegation.
- 5.5  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Registrar or their nominee may:
- a) dismiss the alleged breach with no further action.

b) uphold the alleged breach and conclude the process subject to certain conditions. Conditions may include but are not limited to, requiring that the respondent writes a satisfactory letter of apology or makes good any damage to property caused. Such conditions are intended to provide the respondent with a learning and remediation opportunity deemed appropriate to the nature of the breach.

- c) uphold the alleged breach and apply one or more of the following penalties.
- Issue a letter of warning to the student regarding their future behaviour. The matter may be referred to should any further allegations be made against the respondent.
- Impose a fine not exceeding €250.

- In the case of academic misconduct reduction of a grade up to and including the application of No Merit Grade (NM) for the module where academic misconduct has occurred.  Reduction of the module grade may include capping of a grade for any remediation attempts taken by the respondent, up to and including grades for repeat attempts at a module, where repeat grade scale is normally used.
- In cases where a reduction of a grade results in a requirement that the respondent repeats the module in which academic misconduct has occurred, the Registrar of their nominee may impose capping of a grade for the repeat attempt of the module. Such a cap may be imposed on a specific assessment component(s) or an overall module grade. Where a module is not offered the substitute module may be capped in accordance with the repeat grade scale.
- Disallow the student from taking a resit examination(s) next time a resit assessment is offered, and/ or to require the respondent to repeat the module in full, with or without capping of the repeat attempt grade.
- In addition to the penalties above, a respondent may be required to  undertake an activity / action intended to satisfy the University that the respondent understands the consequences of their conduct and learns from the experience.
- d)  refer the matter to a Student Disciplinary Committee, without making any decision.

e)    where  an  alleged  breach  is  of  a  serious  nature  and/or a  student's  behaviour  is  negatively  impacting members  of  the  University  community,  and  without  prejudice,  impose  a  temporary  suspension  of  the respondent from the University, a University facility and/ or service or postpone the conferral of academic award, scholarship, or prize pending the outcome of a Student Discipline Procedure.

- 5.6 Decisions will be made based on all the information available, including the student's response to the allegation and the nature and seriousness of the matter. The outcome will be communicated to student in writing.

- 5.10 Appeals may be made against penalties imposed under section 5.5.c. of this procedure, in accordance with the Student Appeal Procedure and within 10 working days, see section 8. Appeals. Referral to a Student Disciplinary Committee  Hearing  or  a  decision  to  impose  a  suspension  is  determined  without  any  decision  regarding  the allegation, and therefore cannot be appealed.
- 5.11 Where the matter is resolved at the Student Conduct Meeting stage of the process, a communication will be issued to the complainant/reporting party to advise that the matter has been dealt with and to communicate the outcome of the meeting.
- 5.12 Where a student fails to engage with the Student Discipline Procedure by failing to attend and participate in the Student Conduct meeting, and following reasonable attempts to accommodate the student, the Registrar or their nominee may refer the matter to a Student Disciplinary Committee or may decide to adjudicate on the matter in the student's absence , relying on the documentation submitted.
- 5.13 Where a student fails to attend a Student Conduct Meeting without good reason and/or fails to engage with the Student  Discipline  Procedure  without  good  reason,  the  Registrar,  or  their  nominee  may  impose  a  temporary suspension or other temporary measures provided for in 5.5 e) above pending the outcome of a Student Discipline Procedure.
