## 1. Purpose

Research and teaching-active retired faculty make an important contribution to the University Community through their wide range of skills, knowledge and contacts, which should be encouraged and recognised. They can play a role on the national and international stage, greatly enhancing the reputation of the University. Through activities such as research and publication, mentoring and coaching (faculty &amp; students), networking and advocating, guest lecturing and tutoring they can enhance the University's reputation and support the advancements of its objectives. It is common practice in other universities to leverage this resource through clear policies and procedures that set- out what engagement opportunities and support are available upon retirement.

A range of supports are available for retired employees of the University, however a small number of specific measures as outlined in this policy can have a significant impact increasing the number and activity of retired research and teaching-active faculty.

## 2. Scope

To apply for and maintain an enhanced level of support, retired-faculty members must meet the following criteria:

## General

- Retired from their paid university academic role and completed any post-retirement contract, if applicable
- Willing to support University objectives and enhance the reputation of the University through their activities
- Have a record of achievement across research, teaching and contribution as appropriate

## Research specific

- Willing to continue with their research activities for the benefit of the University in a non-paid, voluntary role
- Maintain an up to date profile on UCD's research management system, where appropriate
- Demonstrate they are research-active by maintaining a publication record under the Output Based Research Support Scheme (OBRSS)

## Teaching specific

- Willing to continue with their teaching activities for the benefit of the University in a non-paid, voluntary role
- Interested in mentoring and coaching less experienced Faculty and/or students

Please note, given the administrative responsibilities required, they will not be appointed as module coordinator, as this is not compatible with the voluntary nature of the role.

## 3. Principles

This policy details a more structured approach to supporting this cohort of retired faculty and acknowledging their contributions as members of the University community. It does not address the broader requirement to recognise and support the University's retired employee community.

Recognition of a retired faculty member, under this policy, can only be awarded where the person meets University standards and criteria, as set out below. Upon satisfying the criteria, a Head of School (HOS) who my also consult with the School Executive to gather further information, will make a recommendation to the appropriate College Principal for award.

## 4. Roles and responsibilities

Preparation for retirement of a faculty member is an important role for the Head of School and conversations and planning should initiate at least two years prior to the proposed retirement date. Where an individual has already retired prior to the Policy being implemented, and the Head of School has no opportunity to initiate the conversation prior to retirement, they may still do so assuming the conditions which follow relating to suitability are met. As part of the conversation, a HOS should identify the faculty member's suitability and interest in continuing to be involved in the research and/or teaching activity of the University in a voluntary capacity post retirement. If deemed suitable, the following application process would apply:

1. HOS ascertains the retiring faculty member's suitability for a specific voluntary project or role involving their research and/or teaching input post retirement using the following criteria:
- Alignment of proposed voluntary project or role with School strategy, objectives and ongoing plans
- School has the capacity to manage the project or role including resources (human) and budget, that may be required
- Availability of retiring faculty member to complete project or role, keeping in mind the voluntary nature of the project or role
- That the project or role does not replace current paid role(s) held by School member
- The faculty member's performance meets the standards required by the University. In addressing this the HOS to consider research achievements, teaching record, overall contribution to the school and University, P4G participation, mentoring record and any other relevant factors. The School Executive may also provide a forum to gather further information.
2. The retiring faculty member completes an application form (available on the HR website), indicating the areas of work (for example research and publication, mentoring and coaching faculty &amp; students, guest lecturing and tutoring) and specific projects/role they intent to continuing pursuing and any specific supports that work might require.
3. Applications are reviewed by HOS, with reference to the criteria outlined above, including discussions on how any supports (over and above those listed below) are provided. HOS to

confirm with University Secretariat that Emeritus title has/is being conferred. If the HOS recommends the application, they send it on to the relevant College Principal.

4. College Principal reviews application with reference to the specified voluntary project proposed against school criteria and faculty member's past performance and approves or not. Principal notifies HOS and Vice-Principal RII/T&amp;L as appropriate - thus ensuring awareness of the potential resource on offer.
5. Approvals to be advised to UCD HR (hrhelpdesk@ucd.ie) (for recording under new category on CORE) so that required access rights could be granted by the appropriate system owner
6. HOS prompted annually, after initial 24 months, (in May each year) to review continuation of the applicant in the voluntary role
