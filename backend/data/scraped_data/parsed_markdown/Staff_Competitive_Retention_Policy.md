## Staff Competitive Retention Policy

<!-- image -->

Policy owner: UCD HR

Approval date and body

UMT, 2 November 2021

## 1. Purpose

The University needs to be in a position to act swiftly and decisively in a competitive market to retain the services of individuals whose departure would:

- Cause a significant and immediate diminution in the services offered by the University.
- Cause a crisis for the University within a short timeframe and where the duties of the departing individual could not be assumed by another individual or group within an acceptable time frame.

It is anticipated that this policy will be invoked only in exceptional circumstances and will be available for use only in cases of posts at a senior level - staff at SAO4 or above, or where the competing offer is made at the equivalent of SAO4 or above.

The University Management Team (UMT) will determine whether the post is sufficiently critical to warrant the use of this policy and the UMT will equally determine whether the track record of the individual merits the use of this policy.

## 2. Scope

The policy will be applicable only in cases where the holder of a critical post has been offered a post external to UCD.

Where the salary offered is in excess of the salary currently being paid in UCD (written confirmation of the salary offered by the external organisation will in all cases be required), the UMT may, at its discretion offer a salary to match an external offer, provided that such a salary is contained within an existing approved scale of remuneration and the performance and role of the individual is compatible with the grade level corresponding to the salary.

In the case of an individual on a temporary contract, the UMT may, at its discretion, elect to extend the duration of the contract, or convert that contract to permanent, providing that this change can be done within public pay policy constraints.

## 3. Principles

- 3.1 The consideration of applications is founded on the principles of equality, confidentiality and the application of transparent criteria in the decision making process.
- 3.2 The assessment of applications will rest both on the criticality of the post and the excellence of the track record of the applicant. The sponsor of the application (relevant College Principal/VP) will be required to illustrate exceptional performance in their duties by the

- individual concerned and the UMT will be required to confirm that the post is critical to the effective running of the University.
- 3.3 Applications should be initiated by the relevant College Principal or Vice President and be submitted to Promotions &amp; Grading via promotions@ucd.ie. When an application has been received by UCD HR, UCD HR will forward a copy to the President (or in his absence the Registrar).  The President (or Registrar), following consultation with the relevant College Principal or Vice-President will determine if there is a prima facie case to assess this application.
- 3.4 Where the President (or Registrar) agrees that there is a prima facie case to assess an applicant under this procedure, he/she will circulate the application to all members of the UMT.
- 3.5 The UMT will consider the application at its next scheduled meeting, or in exceptional circumstances it may convene a special meeting to consider an application.  The relevant Head of School or Head of Unit will be invited to the UMT meeting.  He/she will be required to:
- Comment on the quality and criticality of the individual's work;
- Answer questions/clarify issues in relation to the application for the UMT.

The UMT will review the application and will make a decision on the application.

- 3.6 The decision of the UMT is final. The College Principal/VP/Head of School/Head of Unit and individual concerned will be informed of the UMT's decision. The UMT will forward its decision to the Governing Authority for noting.

## 4. Roles and responsibilities
