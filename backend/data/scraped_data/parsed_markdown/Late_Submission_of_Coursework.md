## Late Submission of Coursework Policy

Policy owner:

## Approval date and body:

Assessment, UCD Registry

Approved by ACCE on 30 January 2020

Approved by ACEC on 6 February 2020

## 1.  Purpose

Coursework is a form of learning and assessment that is widely used in the university. The university expects that coursework will be submitted on time as this develops the important skill of planning work and completing it to a deadline. However, the university also recognises that, on occasion and due to circumstances beyond control, this may not be possible. The university also firmly upholds the principle of equity and that it is unfair for students to gain an unfair advantage by choosing to submit their work late.

The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance on the submission of coursework for assessment; to outline what penalties apply should coursework be submitted late; and to provide information on how to seek approval for late submission, should circumstances occur that prevent timely submission.

## 2.  Scope

This policy applies to all UCD students who are undertaking taught modules in the university. It does not apply to graduate research, as there are separate guidelines that cover extension requests. 1

## 3.  Submission of Coursework

The process for submission of Late Submission applications is determined by the School and must be clearly communicated to students in advance of coursework submission.

## 3.1. Students must be informed of the following:

- The latest time and date for submission for each item of coursework.
- The acceptable mode of delivery, paper, electronic or both.
- To whom the submission should be made, for example, the School Office Administrator or a specified member of Faculty or T utor/Demonstrator.
- Where late submission of coursework is not possible, an alternative approach to the assessment (see section 2.4), for example calculating a component mark excluding the missed work.
- 3.2. Where a student does not submit coursework to the appropriate location, person or through the specified route, it is not considered submitted and may not be graded.
- 3.3. Where delivery by hand is required, Schools must establish a mechanism to confirm submission of coursework, such as a procedure where the student signs in the work or is issued with a receipt.

## 4. Approved Late Submission

On occasion a student may not be able to submit coursework by the due date. Local resolution in such cases is encouraged and the following procedure may be used to ensure appropriate decision making and record keeping. Where more complicated issues or issues that persist over a period longer than 10 working days are involved, the Extenuating Circumstances policy 2  should be invoked.

The local approval process is designed to be simple. Supporting documentation should be provided where possible but will not always be required. This will depend on the nature of the circumstances and length of extension requested.

- 4.1. Completed applications may be submitted to the School Office unless a specified alternative has been indicated, e.g. the Module Coordinator. The 'Application Form for Late Submission of Coursework' may be used and supporting evidence attached where relevant.
- 4.2. The application is to be considered by the Module Coordinator in a timely manner and the applicant informed in writing as soon as possible.
- 4.3. If the application is approved, a revised submission date for the assessment will be agreed and no penalty will be applied. The length of time given as an extension will depend on the nature of the circumstance and the supporting evidence provided where relevant. For example, a medical cert which covers a week will result in an extension of a week.
- 4.4. The School, or the Module Coordinator on behalf of the School, is responsible for retaining a record of all decisions made, in accordance with GDPR guidelines.
- 4.5. In no circumstances can an extension of more than 10 working days be given under this procedure. Where more than 10 working days are necessary, the student should be directed to make a formal extenuating circumstances application via the relevant College or School Office.

## 5. Late Submission

Where a student is late in submitting coursework for assessment, without extenuating circumstances/approved late submission approval, the following with penalties will apply:

- 5.1. Coursework submitted up to 10 working days past the due date will be graded but a grade penalty will be applied.
- 5.1.1. Coursework submitted at any time up to and including 5 working days after the due date will have the grade awarded reduced by one grade point (for example, from B- to C+).
- 5.1.2. Coursework submitted more than 5 working days but up to and including 10 working days after the due date will have the grade reduced by two grade points (for example, from B- to C).
- 5.2. Coursework received more than 10 working days after the due date will not be accepted or graded.

## 6. Late Submission Not Permitted

- 6.1. The nature and circumstances associated with some assessment instruments may make it not feasible to accept late submission of the coursework, whether with extenuating circumstances or not, this is because, for example, feedback may be offered to students within 10 working days of the original submission date. This must be made clear to students in the module descriptor and in the specification of the assessment. A suitable alternative arrangement must be made available to students with approved extenuating circumstances.

2 Please note there are separate guidelines, procedures and pro-forma for Extenuating Circumstances: https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W HU MENU.P PUBLISH?p tag=GD-DOCLAND&amp;ID=126

## Application Form for Late Submission of Coursework

Unless otherwise indicated by the School, this form may be used in such circumstances where a student knows that, for good reason, a deadline cannot be met or has not been met. It is designed to provide a simple local solution to occasional issues that may arise. Supporting documentation may not always be required, however, this will depend on the nature of the circumstances and length of extension requested.

For consideration of complicated issues or issues that persist over a period longer than 10 working days, please refer to UCD's Extenuating Circumstances policy.
