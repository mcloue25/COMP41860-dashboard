    "question": "How do I log in to UCD IT Systems including SISWeb, Brightspace or UCD Email?",
    "answer_text": "Log in by selecting Current Student or All Other Users . Current Students use their @ucdconnect.ie email; All Other Users use their username (i.e. student number). If you do not know your student number, please AskUs. Password = 6-digit DOB (DDMMYY) unless ​you changed​ it. Full info below: When accessing UCD IT Systems, users will see a splash screen with two buttons: \"Current Students\" and \"All Other Users\". For Current Students Once Current Students is selected from the screen, students will log in using their @ucdconnect.ie email address rather than their UCD Connect Username. After entering the email address and clicking next, there will be a second prompt for the password to be entered. For All Others Users (including Alumni and Applicants) Once All Other Users is selected from the screen shown above, all other users will proceed to the username and password screen where you log in using your username and, if required, receive your regular Duo MFA notification as per the current process. For a detailed step-by-step guide, watch our video How to Log in to UCD IT Systems here. FAQ Who does the Current Student option cover? “Current Students” refers to individuals who are presently enrolled and actively pursuing their academic studies in UCD. This group includes students registered in various academic programs for example undergraduate, postgraduate, diploma, or certificate courses. (All who have not yet completed or withdrawn from their studies.) Who does the All Other Users option cover? “All Other Users” refers to Faculty & Staff, Casual Hourly Claimant, Non Contractual Appointee (incl Adjunct), Post Retirement Contracts & Research Teaching Active Retired (RTA)*, Retired Staff & Emeritus, Visitor/Affiliates that have IT access Alumni (Students who have graduated) and Direct Applicants. When do I move from a Current Student to All Other Users? Once Current Students complete their studies in UCD and become Alumni, they will login to the Alumni Portal using the \"All Other Users\" option. What happens if I click the wrong option? If you choose the incorrect option for your account you will not be able to log in and will receive an error message.",

    "question": "What do I need to know about my SUSI Grant?",
    "answer_text": "There are 2 types of SUSI grants: Student Contribution charge payment Maintenance payment (not all grant students are awarded maintenance). You must apply every academic year for your grant, it does not renew automatically. SUSI will only pay a grant for the standard duration of your programme (e.g. if your programme is 3 years you will receive grant payments for 3 years only). If you are taking a lesser or greater credit load than the standard 60 credits per academic year, contact your college office & student desk as this may impact your grant. Note, SUSI will not pay for any stage over 3 trimesters. If you plan to withdraw from modules, either before or after week 8, you must AskUs first. If you are taking a Leave of Absence for a trimester, or a year, you must tell SUSI & AskUs for guidance. SUSI will not pay for repeat students (if you are in the same stage you were in last year). Payment of the SUSI grant each year is if dependent on progression to the next stage of your programme (min of 50 credits per stage). If you are a student who is repeating a trimester/ year on the same course then you are not eligible for a grant until you progress. If you have not progressed to the next stage of your programme by the start of the next academic year you would be eligible for the grant if you mid-year progress when you reach 50 credits. It is important to note, that your grant will be frozen until you pass 50 credits. If you mid-year progress after the Christmas exams your grant will be applied in late January/early February. Only passed modules are counted towards progression. Incomplete IX (extenuating) grades do not count towards progression. SUSI will pay a maximum of €2000 per year towards the Student Contribution Charge. If your student contribution exceeds this amount you will have to pay the excess. Note that if you withdraw from a module after the week 8 deadline (WN grades only) this charge will be covered by SUSI in the current year but there will be no charge to take the module again subsequently. If you register for more than 60 credits per year you would be liable for a €166.67 Student Contribution charge per 5 credit module. Note that SUSI does not pay for repeat/resit modules and these do not count towards the 60 credit maximum of student contribution. Students repeating may apply to SUSI for Exceptional Circumstances. (Note this is not related to UCD Exceptional Circumstances). If you are awarded any IX grades, due to extenuating circumstances , you have the opportunity to remediate (complete) the module/s at the next available opportunity with no additional charge (within two trimesters). If you do not progress to the next stage of your programme due to being awarded IX grades, you must contact the Student Desk for advice at the beginning of the year. If you are expecting to receive the SUSI Grant please do not be concerned about meeting the September Payment deadline. Your grant does not cover the Student Centre Levy of €254. You will need to pay for this yourself. New SUSI Support Tel no: 0818 888 777/ Email: (opens in a new window) support@susi.ie",
