Chapter 21 of Statute 6 is hereby replaced by the following amended text:

## DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES

## General Principles

1. All employees of the University should be managed appropriately, fairly and consistently in all aspects of their work. Most problems relating to performance and conduct can be dealt with before reaching the point at which disciplinary action is contemplated by University management within normal management procedures. Failure to deal with problems of inderpertormance and misconduct is liable to undermine the effective operations of th Jniversity and places an unfair burden on other employees. UCD will ensure that all employee who may be required to carry out a disciplinary process in accordance with this statute will be adequately trained to do so.
2. Where performance and conduct problems cannot be resolved informally, they must be managed in accordance with these Disciplinary Procedures, set out in this Statute in a manner that protects the dignity of the employee concerned and of all members of the UCD community
3. Misconduct encompasses a breach of standards of conduct in the workplace or in the course of employment, failure in performance of duties and may include the failure to follow relevant University policies and procedures. Misconduct may also include inappropriate behaviour outside the workplace which has an impact or could reasonably be likely to have an impact within the workplace.
4. Where disciplinary action is proposed the University must ensure that employees, against whom disciplinary action is proposed are dealt with in a fair and equitable manner in accordance with the Universities Act 1997, and the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures) (Declaration) Order, 2000, which has these general
5. 4.1 details of any allegations or complaints are put to the employee concerned;
6. 4.2 the employee concerned is given the opportunity to respond fully to any such allegations or complaints;
7. 4.3 the employee concerned is given the opportunity to avail of the right to be represented during the procedure; and
8. 4.4 the employee concerned has the right to a fair and impartial determination of the issues concerned, taking into account any representations made by, or on behalf of, the employee and any other relevant or appropriate evidence, factors, or circumstances.
5. A member of the academic staff of the University shall have the freedom, within the law, in their teaching, research and any other activities either in or outside the University, to question and test received wisdom, to put forward new ideas and to state controversial or unpopular opinions and shall not be disadvantaged, or subject to less favourable treatment by the University, for the exercise of that freedom, consistent with section 14(2) of the Universities Act 1997.
6. It is essential for the operation of these Disciplinary Procedures set out in this Statute that all employees cooperate fully in any disciplinary process in a timely manner. An employee who

fails to co-operate in a disciplinary process shall be in breach of the employee's terms of employment and subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

7. These Disciplinary Procedures apply to all UCD employees except any employee who is within their probationary period. Employees within their probationary period will be managed appropriately through the University's probation policy. These Disciplinary Procedures will not operate to deprive any employee of any of their entitlements which continue by reason of section 25(8) of the Universities Act 1997.

## Suspension of Emplovee

8. In certain cases, the University may have to consider suspending an employee with pay pending the conclusion of an investigation and/or a disciplinary process. Any suspension shall be neutral in nature and not infer any wrong doing on the part of the suspended employee nor shall it influence or infer any finding of the investigation. The suspension should be kept under review during the investigation and should not be unnecessarily protracted. The decision to suspend an employee as a precautionary measure should depend on the seriousness of the situation. Employees may be suspended where there are legitimate concerns relating to a range of issues, such as, but not limited to, the employer's reputation; the safety, health and welfare of employees; the potential for intimidation or interference with witnesses or evidence, etc. This list is illustrative only, and cases should be assessed on their own merits. Prior to deciding to suspend an employee, the employee should, where circumstances reasonably allow, be advised of the reasons why suspension is being considered. The employee should be given the opportunity, if the employee wishes, to respond to that proposal and afforded the right of representation by a colleague of their choice or a whole-time official of a recognised union. As an alternative to suspension, an employee may be given the option of taking voluntary leave. Suspension can occur at any stage during the disciplinary process.
9. During any period of suspension, an employee shall not be permitted to attend at the University's premises and/or make contact with employees or students of the University regarding University business, or matters relating to their suspension, without the prior written consent of the University and should ordinarily not be permitted, unless the University consider it feasible, to have access to the University information technology systems. Any employee being placed on suspension must confirm their non-UCD email address prior to access to University IT systems being denied.

## Assignment of Functions

10. In this Statute where "President" or "Director of Human Resources" appears in the text, the term should be taken to include any other employee of appropriate seniority to whom relevant functions have been assigned by the President or Director of Human Resources as appropriate. In the case of dismissal, the nominee must be a member of Senior Management. In this Statute when reference is made to a "Line Manager" the function may be exercised by the employees designated manager or by the designated manager's manager. For academic staff, this function will be carried out by the relevant Head of School, College Principal and then the President or Director of Human Resources. When issues concerning a potential conflict of interest arise, the University will be responsible for ensuring that the decision-maker is an objective party in the disciplinary process. If a decision-maker resigns from their post but remains in UCD or completes their term of office (e.g. Head of School) they will complete the disciplinary process that has commenced. If the decision-maker resigns and leaves UCD or is incapacitated, then a 'de novo' hearing will take place.

## Disciplinary Sanctions

11. In this Statute, the term "disciplinary sanction" means action taken by reason of, or as a Elegate or paping shar the or laye enemed a fied op from ari dies to an unsatisfactory behaviour. Disciplinary sanctions may comprise one or more of the following actions:
2. 11.1 formal warnings;
3. 11.2 deferral of an increment for the period of the incremental cycle;
4. 11.3 reducing the employee to a specified lower grade or rank on a temporary or permanent basis;
5. 11.4 dismissal.

The sanctions referred to at 11.2 to 11.4 will be imposed at the conclusion of Stage 4 of the disciplinary process. The disciplinary sanctions referred to at 11.1 to 11.3 may be suspended or deferred at the discretion of the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, if the employee concerned is absent from work for any reason. Upon the employee's return to work, the sanction(s) may be reinstated or resumed.

12. The outcome of an investigation under the University's Dignity and Respect Policy, Research Integrity Policy, Child Protection or other policies may result in referral to this Disciplinary Process. The investigation report will constitute a finding of fact and any subsequent disciplinary process will be carried out by the line manager/Head of School. If it is determined by the line manager/Head of School following a disciplinary hearing that a serious infringement or act of gross misconduct may have occurred, then the matter will be referred to the Director of Human Resources as per paragraph 30 of this statute.

Acts of gross misconduct are construed as being deliberate acts by the employee, or the neglect/failure of the employee to act, to the detriment of UCD.

Examples of gross misconduct are as follows:

- Gross incompetence/negligence
- Bullying/harassment/intimidation/discrimination
- Physical violence or threatening behaviour
- Sexual harassment
- : Falsifying university documents Deliberate disregard for health and safety precautions likely to endanger any person

This list is not exhaustive, see appendix 1.

## General Management of Conduct and Performance

13. It is expected that, if the conduct or performance of an employee is not of a standard required by the College/School/Unit or any other recognised area, the line manager/Head of School should bring this to the employee's attention at the earliest opportunity. Wherever possible, this should be carried out informally with the employee being informed of the matter and given the opportunity to offer explanation and comment before any decision to invoke the disciplinary process is taken. The line manager/Head of School should ensure that the employee understands in what way their performance/conduct has fallen below reasonable expectations. Where an improvement might be effected without recourse to disciplinary action, guidance should be provided as appropriate.
14. Where it has not proved possible or where by reason of the gravity of the matter it is not appropriate to deal with misconduct, irregularity, neglect, omission or unsatisfactory behaviour informally to the satisfaction of management, the matter shall be dealt with under the Formal Disciplinary Procedures set out in this Statute.

## Formal Disciplinary Procedures

15. (Verbal Warning) and thereafter may escalate beyond what would otherwise be the next Stage. This should only been done when, in the reasonable opinion of the decision-maker, the circumstances of the case justify such escalation. Having , instituted formal disciplinary proceedings at a particular stage, the decision-maker may, at their absolute discretion, decide to issue a disciplinary sanction at a stage lower than those in which the proceedings were originally instituted.
16. Employees need to give at least three days notice if they are unable to attend the scheduled hearing and three days' notice of any intention to be accompanied by a third party to the hearing.
17. If any party, including an employee, is not available to fully engage in the disciplinary process for any reason, the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, may postpone or defer the disciplinary process in the interests of thoroughness and fair procedures for a reasonable period.

## Failure of an Emplovee to Cooperate with Formal Disciplinary Procedures

18. Employees are required to attend disciplinary hearings and cooperate with all aspects of the disciplinary processes detailed in this Statute. Disciplinary hearings may be conducted, and sanctions may be imposed on an employee, notwithstanding the employee's failure to attend a disciplinary hearing(s) and/or cooperate with these disciplinary procedures.

## Stage 1 - Verbal Warning

19. If an issue of conduct or performance arises in respect of which a Verbal Warning may be appropriate, a formal disciplinary investigation meeting with the employee should be conducted by the line manager/Head of School or a nominee of the Director of Human Resources. The line manager/Head of School may be accompanied by an appropriate HR representative. The employee should be given at least five working days' notice of the meeting. The notice should state the purpose of the meeting and a clear statement of the areas where the employee's conduct and/or performance is considered unsatisfactory. The employee must confirm attendance at the hearing at least three days before the scheduled hearing date. The employee may be accompanied at any such meeting by a colleague of their choice or by a whole-time official of a recognised union. The line manager/Head of School conducting the disciplinary hearing will

At the meeting, the employee will be given an opportunity to respond. This response may involve written evidence, including witness statements, in support of their case. Full consideration shall be given to the employee's responses. The outcome of the disciplinary investigation meeting should ordinarily be communicated to the employee within ten working days of the conclusion of the meeting. Where a Verbal Warning is given, it should state the improvement required, where appropriate the timescale for improvement, and the consequences of failure to improve. The warning should inform the employee that further sanction(s) may be considered if there is no sustained, satisfactory improvement. A record of the Verbal Warning shall be retained on the employee's HR file. This record shall be removed from the file after six months, subject to satisfactory improvement and/or no reoccurance during this period. The six months period relates to a continuous period of the employee being at work and any period of absence arising from sick leave will be discounted during this period. If in the opinion of the line manager/Head of School or a nominee of the Director of Human Resources, following the holding of the disciplinary investigation meeting, there is no basis for the issue of a Verbal Warning, then the person concerned may decide that no further action should be taken in the matter, no record of the investigation proceedings shall be held on the employee's record in this instance. Hearings may be conducted, and disciplinary sanctions may be imposed on an employee notwithstanding the employee's failure to attend hearings or cooperate with the investigation process.

20. The line-manager/Head of School should ensure that the employee is made aware of their right to appeal any disciplinary sanction imposed within 10 working days. This appeal will be considered without prejudice.

## Stage 2 - Written Warning

21. If, during the currency of a Verbal Warning, an employee fails to make the necessary improvement or if the matter is such as to possibly merit a Written Warning, whether or not there was previously a Verbal Warning, the matter will ordinarily proceed to or commence at Stage 2. A formal disciplinary investigation meeting with the employee shall be conducted by the line manager/Head of School or a nominee of the Director of Human Resources. The line manager/Head of School may be accompanied by an appropriate HR representative. The employee shall be given at least five working days' notice of any meeting. The notice should state the purpose of the meeting and a clear statement of the areas where the employee's conduct and/or performance is considered unsatisfactory. The employee must confirm attendance at the hearing at least three days before the scheduled hearing date. The employee may be accompanied at any such meeting by a colleague of the employee's choice or by a whole-time official of a recognised union. The line manager/Head of School conducting the disciplinary , will determine what witnesses, if any, will be called. The employee can submit suggestions for witnesses, which will be considered by the line manager/Head of School.
22. At the meeting, the employee shall be given an opportunity to respond. This response may involve written evidence, including witness statements, in support of their case. Full consideration shall be given to the employee's responses. The outcome of the disciplinary investigation meeting should ordinarily be communicated to the employee within ten working days of the conclusion of the meeting. Where a Written Warning is given, it should state the improvement required, where appropriate the timescale for improvement and the consequences of failure to improve. The warning should inform the employee that further sanction(s) may be considered if there is no sustained, satisfactory improvement. A record shall be retained of the Written Warning in the employee's HR file. The Written Warning shall be removed from the HR file after 12 months, subject to satisfactory improvement and/or no reoccurance during this period. If in the opinion of the line manager/Head of School or a nominee of the Director of

Human Resources, following the holding of the disciplinary investigation meeting, there is no basis for the issue of a Written Warning, then the person concerned may decide that no further action should be taken in the matter, no record of the investigation proceedings shall be held on the employee's record in this instance. Hearings may be conducted, and disciplinary sanctions may be imposed on an employee notwithstanding the employee's failure to attend hearings or cooperate with the investigation process.

23. The line-manager/Head of School should ensure that the employee is made aware of their right to appeal any disciplinary sanction imposed within 10 working days. This appeal will be considered without prejudice.

## Stage 3 - Final Written Warning

24. If, during the currency of a Written Warning, an employee fails to make the necessary improvement or if the matter is such as to possibly merit a Final Written Warning, whether or not there was previously a Verbal and/or Written Warning, a formal disciplinary hearing with the employee shall be conducted by a more senior manager (original line manager's manager/College Principal) or a nominee of the Director of Human Resources. The decisionmaker may be accompanied by an appropriate HR representative. The employee shall be given at least five working days' notice of any hearing; the notice should state the purpose of the hearing and a clear statement of the areas where their conduct and/or performance is considered unsatisfactory. The employee must confirm attendance at the hearing at least three days before the scheduled hearing date. The employee concerned may be accompanied at any such hearing by a colleague of the employee's choice or by a whole-time official of a recognised union. The decision-maker conducting the disciplinary hearing will determine what witnesses, if any, will be called. The employee can submit suggestions for witnesses, which will be considered by the decision-maker.
25. At the hearing, the employee shall be given an opportunity to respond. This response may involve written evidence, including witness statements, in support of their case. Full consideration shall be given to the employee's response. The outcome of the disciplinary hearing should ordinarily be communicated to the employee within ten working days of the conclusion of the hearing. Where a Final Written Warning is given, it should include full details of the unsatisfactory conduct or performance, it should state the improvement required, where appropriate the timescale for improvement and the consequences of failure to improve and should inform the employee that failure to modify their conduct or performance should lead to further disciplinary action up to and possibly including dismissal. A record shall be retained of the Final Written Warning in the employee's HR file. The Final Written Warning shall be removed after 12 months, subject to satisfactory improvement and/or no reoccurance during this period. If in the opinion of the senior manager or nominee of the Director of Human Resources, following the holding of the disciplinary hearing, there is no basis for the issue of a final Written Warning, then the person concerned may decide that no further action should be taken in the matter, no record of the investigation proceedings shall be held on the employee's record in this instance. Hearings may be conducted, and disciplinary sanctions may be imposed on an employee notwithstanding the employee's failure to attend hearings or cooperate with the investigation process.
26. The decision-maker should ensure that the employee is made aware of their right to appeal any disciplinary sanction imposed within 10 working days. This appeal will be considered without prejudice.

## Stage 4 - Further Disciplinary Action up to and including Dismissal and Gross Misconduct

27. Where an employee has failed to make adequate improvements to their behaviour, conduct or performance, or continues any acts) or omission(s) that has resulted in disciplinary sanction(s) being issued under paragraphs 19 to 26, further disciplinary sanctions, as provided for in paragraph 11.2 to 11.4, up to and including dismissal, may be taken in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs 28 to 36 below.
28. Gross misconduct' is a serious breach of the University's rules and procedures or of recognised and accepted standards of behaviour which results in a breakdown of the relationship of trust and confidence between the University and the employee concerned. The line manager/Head of School will determine what constitutes a 'serious breach' as per paragraph 12 of this statute. Gross misconduct shall justify disciplinary action set out in these Disciplinary Procedures, up to and including dismissal, in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs 29 to 35 below, without giving verbal or written warnings as provided for in paragraphs 19 to 26 above.
29. Where further disciplinary action up to and including dismissal, as described at paragraph 27, is contemplated, or an allegation of gross misconduct, as described at paragraph 28, has occurred, the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, may give effect to the process set out at paragraphs 30 to 36 below.
30. 30.1 Where a disciplinary investigation has not already occurred and where an allegation or suspicion of gross misconduct has been raised against an employee, or a Final Written Warning in relation to misconduct, irregularity, neglect, unsatisfactory behaviour or underperformance has failed to result in an improvement, and further disciplinary action is contemplated, the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, shall consider the matter and shall cause an investigation to be undertaken. Any investigation shall be carried out by such a person or persons as may be appointed by the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, from inside or outside the University. The investigation should be a fact-finding exercise; it should not make any binding decisions on the imposition of sanctions or the outcome of the disciplinary process.
5. 30.2 Where a disciplinary investigation has been carried out by the line manager/Head of School following findings of fact of a breach of the UCD Dignity and Respect Policy, Research Integrity Policy, Child Protection Policy or any other UCD policy and they have concluded that a serious infringement or act of gross misconduct may have occurred, then the matter will be referred to the Director of Human Resources for consideration under paragraph 32.
6. 30.3 where in bye or lian to regains which may. discretion, having invited written representations from the employee and considered same, decide whether or not an investigation is necessary and shall advise the employee accordingly.

31. Any investigation carried out under paragraph 30 will be carried out under Terms of Reference (which may provide for an oral hearing) on which the employee will be consulted and will be completed as soon as possible. Employees are required to cooperate fully with all investigations and attend hearings as required. Hearings may be conducted, and disciplinary sanctions may be imposed on an employee notwithstanding the employee's failure to attend hearings or cooperate with the investigation process. It is not expected that investigations should take longer than

' See the Appendix 1 for examples of gross misconduct.

forty working days after being commissioned by the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, but there may be cases where, because of the circumstances, the timeline for the investigation is extended by the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, in the interests of thoroughness and fair procedures.

32. Where the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, is satisfied on the basis of their consideration of the matter and such investigation or further investigation, if any, as they have had undertaken that further disciplinary action as provided for in these Disciplinary Procedures may be warranted, they shall furnish the employee with:

34. The employee concerned may include, in the employee's response, a request for meeting with the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, to consider the allegation in the light of the material gathered in the course of the investigation. In the event of such a request, the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, shall arrange a meeting with the employee within ten working days of the expiration of the ten-day period referred to at paragraph 33 above. The employee concerned may be accompanied at any such meeting by a colleague of their choice or by a whole-time official of a recognised union or a third party of the employee's choice.

The Director of Human Resources, or nominee, shall inform the employee concerned in writing not later than ten working days after the ten working day period referred to at paragraph 33, or where a meeting has taken place, as described at paragraph 34, not later
36. Where termination of employment or other disciplinary action as provided for at paragraph 11.2 to 11.3 above is proposed under Stage 4 and/or Gross Misconduct proceedings, the Director of Human Resources, or nominee, shall make a recommendation to the President and provide the representations (if any) made by the employee concerned. The decision shall be communicated to the employee in writing. Where the decision to dismiss is made other than for reasons of gross misconduct, notice of termination shall be given in accordance with the employee's terms of employment. Where the President decides to impose a sanction(s) other than dismissal, a record of the sanction shall be retained in the employee's HR file. This record shall be removed after the specified time appropriate to the relevant sanction, subject to satisfactory improvement
