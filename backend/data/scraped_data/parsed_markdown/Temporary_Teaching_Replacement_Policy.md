## 1. Introduction

Teaching is an integral part of the work of UCD Faculty. Temporary teaching replacement (colloquially known as 'teaching buyout')  will only be approved where  it  is  necessary  to  achieve  specific  strategic  objectives,  and  where funding is awarded for that purpose, preferably on a full replacement basis. A temporary teaching replacement may only proceed with the recommendation of  the  Head  of  School  and approval  of  the College  Principal. This  does  not apply to agreed work load practices.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all members of Faculty.

## 3. Definition

Temporary  Teaching  Replacement  is  used  to  describe  a  situation  where funding  is  awarded  to  a  Faculty  member  with  the  specific  purpose  of  a reduction in teaching hours, generally to facilitate his/her working on a funded project of strategic importance  to the university.  The  Faculty  member continues to be paid normally by the School.

## 4. Policy

A Faculty member may, under certain circumstances, apply for a temporary teaching  replacement  by  buying  out  specified  teaching  hours.    All  other components  of  their  workload,  such  as  PhD  supervision,  membership  of university committees and administrative work will continue on a normal basis.

It is the joint responsibility of the Faculty member and the Head of School to ensure that the delivery of the modules of the Faculty member on a teaching buyout meet the required teaching standards expected by the University.

Time  spent  on  a  temporary  teaching  replacement  will  not  be  counted  as qualifying time towards Research Sabbatical.

## 5. Application Process

Heads of School are expected to ensure that the number of Faculty absent in any given academic year does not exceed what is appropriate to the School's size and needs.

Faculty  should  discuss  the  intention  to  apply  for  a  temporary  teaching replacement with their Head of School at the earliest possible opportunity but no  later  than  one  semester  prior  to  the  commencement  intended  teaching replacement period.
