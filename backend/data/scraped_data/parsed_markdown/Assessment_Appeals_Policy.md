## UCD Assessment Appeals Policy and Procedures

Policy Owner: Student Engagement, Conduct, Complaints and Appeals

Approval date and body: Academic

## 1. Purpose

UCD  is  committed  to  providing  an  excellent  education  and  student  experience.  The  University supports improvement  in educational quality and academic decision-making. However,  the University  recognises  that  from  time  to  time  situations  arise  when  a  student  considers  that  they might have grounds for appeal against a decision related to assessment of their academic work. The Assessment Appeals Policy outlines the principles and process for such an appeal. The University is committed to resolving appeals as quickly as possible with emphasis on local  resolution.

## 2. Definitions

An  assessment  appeal  is  a  request  for  a  formal  review,  on  specific  grounds,  of  a  decision  of  an academic  body  charged  with  making  decisions  concerning  student  assessment,  progression  or award.

## 3. Scope

## 3.1 Appellants

The Assessment Appeals Policy applies to all registered students, including students registered to collaborative programmes, and graduands.

An appeal can be submitted collectively by a group of students. In cases where an appeal has been submitted by a group of students the appeal will be considered as a single submission and all students should be in agreement of the grounds and evidence for the  appeal.

## 3.2 Types of appeal

An  appeal  is  a  request  for  a  formal  review  of  a  decision  of  an  academic  body  charged  with making decisions concerning student assessment, progression or award. Decisions that can be appealed under the Assessment Appeals Policy are limited to:

- An appeal against the result of any assessment of students' academic work. An appeal against the  result  of  a  module  can  only  be  submitted  against  a  final  result,  including  an  appeal against a component of a module.
- An appeal against the decision of the Academic Council Committee on Examinations on the award of a Research Master's Degree.
- An appeal against decisions on progression in and award of doctoral programmes. A student can appeal the decision of
- i. The Transfer Assessment Panel or
- ii. The decision of the Academic Council Committee on Examinations on the award.

## 3.3 Grounds for Appeal

An assessment appeal will only be considered on the following grounds:

- Procedural irregularity -there is evidence that the procedures relating to an assessment decision were not followed properly, which may have impacted on the decision.
- Extenuating circumstances -there were extenuating circumstances of which the relevant Governing Board was aware but had rejected, because the application was late and the Governing Board did not consider the reason why the application was late to be valid.
- 3.4 Appeals that do not meet any of the above grounds will not be accepted. Students cannot appeal simply because they are unhappy with a grade awarded or other academic judgement exercised.

Academic judgment is a judgment that is made about a matter where the opinion of an academic expert  is  essential.    Therefore,  in  the  context  of  UCD's  assessment  appeals  process,  academic judgement includes, but is not restricted to, decisions regarding the assessment strategy used, the structure  and  content  of  the  assessment,  assessment  feedback,  the  grade  awarded,  and  the academic standard attained.

An appeal is distinct from a complaint that seeks to raise concerns over the quality of a function, unit or a service provided by the University. Such complaints should be addressed through the Student Complaint Policy and Procedures.

- 3.5 Sometimes a student might be subject to several university procedures. In such cases the Registrar or a person nominated by the Registrar shall decide which procedure takes  precedence.

## 4. Principles

The following principles underpin the Assessment Appeals Policy and appeals process:

- Accessible and user-focused -Easily  available  and  understood, transparent process where outcomes are communicated giving clear reasons for the decisions reached.
- Simple and  timely -Offer opportunities for early resolution avoiding unnecessarily cumbersome and lengthy stages of the process.
- Robust and fair -Support constructive engagement applying principles of natural justice and promote students' confidence in the process by giving students opportunity to voice their concerns in writing and in person as appropriate, giving equal access for all parties to all the evidence and treating all documentation confidentially.
- Supports improvement -Appeals provide an important source of feedback for the University, which contributes to the enhancement of the quality of learning and to the improvement of the Assessment Appeals Policy and process.

## 6. UCD Assessment Appeals Procedure

The University encourages students, faculty and staff to resolve matters as close as possible to the level they arise. Only when such channels have been exhausted will formal appeals procedures apply.

## 6.1 Early resolution

The Head of School should ensure that the School has a timely feedback process in place. The School should provide an appropriate contact person who is available to students for the purpose of feedback and keep an appropriate record of any matters that arise. The School should complete this process as soon as possible after the publication of the final results.

If the School fails to accommodate students' queries or students are not satisfied with the feedb ack and/or resolution provided by the School, and they have stated grounds for initiating an appeal, they may submit a formal  appeal  to  the  Assessment  Appeals  Officer.  Students  registered  to  graduate  research  programmes receive informal and formal feedback in advance of final examination and results. They may submit a formal appeal to the Assessment Appeals Officer directly after the publication of the final results.

## 6.2 The process for submitting a formal assessment appeal

Appeals should be submitted to the Assessment Appeals Officer using the appropriate form provided within 10  working  days of  receiving  the  final  result  of  an  assessment 1 .  It  is  recognised  that  in  exceptional circumstances a student may not meet the stated timeframe. In such exceptional circumstances the Appeals Officer  may allow  the  submission  of  an  appeal  outside  the  stated  timeframe.  Such  submissions  will  be considered on a case by case basis. The decision of the Assessment Appeals Officer on such cases is final.

The submission should include all supporting evidence to be presented to the Student Appeals Committee in support of the appeal. It is the onus of the student to submit the necessary information and evidence to the Committee. A student cannot submit further evidence at a later stage, unless  requested  by  the  Student Appeals Committee. If the submission is deemed incomplete by the Assessment Appeals Officer, the student is advised that they can submit a new appeal once the documentation is complete.

A submission can be deemed ineligible by the Appeals Officer if the submission

- does not fall within the scope (section 3);
- clearly does not meet any of the grounds for appeal (section  3.3);
- does not provide necessary evidence to support the appeal; or
- is not submitted within the given timeframe.

The appellant should note that:

- A student (or group of students) can withdraw from the appeals process at any point before the final decision of the Student Appeals  Committee.
- If a result that contributes to the calculation of a final degree classification is appealed, a student's graduation will be postponed pending the outcome of the appeal.
- Disciplinary actions may be taken against a student who submits false or vexatious material as part of their appeal.

1 A final result is a result ratified by the relevant Governing Board.

## 6.6 Outcomes of formal assessment appeal process
