SISWeb is a portal which gives you access to services and information. You never lose access to SISWeb, even after you graduate or if you leave UCD before completing your programme. To log in go to www.ucd.ie/connect and click on the SISWeb icon. SISWeb is your student portal where you can access and manage your records, register for modules, pay fees, view timetables, and find important documents like transcripts. Alumni can also login to SISWeb to access and order official documents. Brightspace is the official Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) for University College Dublin (UCD). Brightspace is where you can: access course materials, find all your lectures, readings, and assignments in one place. To log into Brightspace, go to www.ucd.ie/connect and click on the Brightspace icon. It's important to note that before you're able to log into Brightspace you must confirm your registration in SISWeb. Until you choose your modules, you won't see anything in Brightspace. All current students have access to Brightspace, but your access will expire roughly 6 months after you complete your programme. Please note that BrightSpace takes 24 hours to update following activation of your registration & any changes made to your module registration.

There are 2 types of SUSI grants: Student Contribution charge payment Maintenance payment (not all grant students are awarded maintenance). You must apply every academic year for your grant, it does not renew automatically. SUSI will only pay a grant for the standard duration of your programme (e.g. if your programme is 3 years you will receive grant payments for 3 years only). If you are taking a lesser or greater credit load than the standard 60 credits per academic year, contact your college office & student desk as this may impact your grant. Note, SUSI will not pay for any stage over 3 trimesters. If you plan to withdraw from modules, either before or after week 8, you must AskUs first. If you are taking a Leave of Absence for a trimester, or a year, you must tell SUSI & AskUs for guidance. SUSI will not pay for repeat students (if you are in the same stage you were in last year). Payment of the SUSI grant each year is if dependent on progression to the next stage of your programme (min of 50 credits per stage). If you are a student who is repeating a trimester/ year on the same course then you are not eligible for a grant until you progress. If you have not progressed to the next stage of your programme by the start of the next academic year you would be eligible for the grant if you mid-year progress when you reach 50 credits. It is important to note, that your grant will be frozen until you pass 50 credits. If you mid-year progress after the Christmas exams your grant will be applied in late January/early February. Only passed modules are counted towards progression. Incomplete IX (extenuating) grades do not count towards progression. SUSI will pay a maximum of €2000 per year towards the Student Contribution Charge. If your student contribution exceeds this amount you will have to pay the excess. Note that if you withdraw from a module after the week 8 deadline (WN grades only) this charge will be covered by SUSI in the current year but there will be no charge to take the module again subsequently. If you register for more than 60 credits per year you would be liable for a €166.67 Student Contribution charge per 5 credit module.

Do I need to submit a new application for Free Fee Assessment each year? If you're already in receipt of Free Frees , you don't need to make a new application the following year. Once Free Fees have been applied to your record, they will continue to be applied to your account automatically, until you have reached the Free Fee limit for your programme (3 year programmes are given a maximum of 180 credits worth of Free Fees and 4 year programmes are given a maximum of 240 credits of Free Fees). Who is eligible for EU Fees? EU fees are based on residency rather than citizenship. For students under 23 In order to be eligible for EU fees, both the student and their parent(s) must have been ordinarily resident in the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation/UK for at least 3 of the last 5 years. For students over 23 In order to be eligible for EU fees, the student must have been ordinarily resident in the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation/UK for at least 3 out of the last 5 years. Exceptions For 2019/20 intake onward For undergraduate and graduate registration - EU fees may apply for EU, EEA, Swiss, or UK citizens, who do not meet the normal residency requirements but who completed at least 5 academic years of study in the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation/UK (at either primary or secondary education). For intake prior to 2019/20 Undergraduate registration - EU fees may apply for applicants born in the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation who do not meet the normal residency requirements but who completed 5+ years of their primary &/or secondary education in the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation and have no previous third level attendance. Graduate registration - EU fees may apply for applicants born in the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation who do not meet the normal residency requirements but who received all of their primary, secondary & third-level education in the EU/EEA/Swiss Confederation. Please refer to our EU Fee Assessment page for more info If you have further questions about EU fee assessment, please AskUs. Are UK applicants still eligible for EU Fees? The Department of Education & Skills has confirmed that students from the UK are still be eligible for the same fee structures as EU students . For further details on the eligibility criteria for EU fees, see the section \"Who is eligible for EU fees\" or visit the EU Fee Assessment page. Students who have UK nationality will continue to meet the citizenship criteria for the Free Fees Scheme. Years spent living in the UK will contribute to the residency criteria for the Free Fees Scheme. For further details on the eligibility criteria for the Free Fees scheme, see the section \"Who is eligible for Free Fees\" or visit the Free Fees page. Students who begin their studies on the EU fee rate will remain on the EU fee rate for the duration of their programme. I think I should be on the EU Fees rate - what should I do? If you meet the criteria for EU fees (see \"Who is eligible for EU fees\" to determine eligibility) but are being charged the non-EU fee rate, it most likely means that you need to complete the online EU fee assessment form & provide supporting documentation to show proof of residency in the EU for 3 out of the last 5 years. Once we receive the necessary documentation, we can carry out the EU fee assessment process & adjust your fees accordingly. You can find acceptable supporting documentation in the checklists below: Checklist for students under 23 Checklist for students over 23 Make an application for EU Fee Assessment online EU Fee Assessment application .

    "question": "What do I need to know about my SUSI Grant?",
    "answer_text": " There are 2 types of SUSI grants: Student Contribution charge payment Maintenance payment (not all grant students are awarded maintenance). You must apply every academic year for your grant, it does not renew automatically. SUSI will only pay a grant for the standard duration of your programme (e.g. if your programme is 3 years you will receive grant payments for 3 years only). If you are taking a lesser or greater credit load than the standard 60 credits per academic year, contact your college office & student desk as this may impact your grant. Note, SUSI will not pay for any stage over 3 trimesters. If you plan to withdraw from modules, either before or after week 8, you must AskUs first. If you are taking a Leave of Absence for a trimester, or a year, you must tell SUSI & AskUs for guidance. SUSI will not pay for repeat students (if you are in the same stage you were in last year). Payment of the SUSI grant each year is if dependent on progression to the next stage of your programme (min of 50 credits per stage). If you are a student who is repeating a trimester/ year on the same course then you are not eligible for a grant until you progress. If you have not progressed to the next stage of your programme by the start of the next academic year you would be eligible for the grant if you mid-year progress when you reach 50 credits. It is important to note, that your grant will be frozen until you pass 50 credits. If you mid-year progress after the Christmas exams your grant will be applied in late January/early February. Only passed modules are counted towards progression. Incomplete IX (extenuating) grades do not count towards progression. SUSI will pay a maximum of €2000 per year towards the Student Contribution Charge. If your student contribution exceeds this amount you will have to pay the excess. Note that if you withdraw from a module after the week 8 deadline (WN grades only) this charge will be covered by SUSI in the current year but there will be no charge to take the module again subsequently. If you register for more than 60 credits per year you would be liable for a €166.67 Student Contribution charge per 5 credit module. Note that SUSI does not pay for repeat/resit modules and these do not count towards the 60 credit maximum of student contribution. Students repeating may apply to SUSI for Exceptional Circumstances. (Note this is not related to UCD Exceptional Circumstances). If you are awarded any IX grades, due to extenuating circumstances , you have the opportunity to remediate (complete) the module/s at the next available opportunity with no additional charge (within two trimesters). If you do not progress to the next stage of your programme due to being awarded IX grades, you must contact the Student Desk for advice at the beginning of the year. If you are expecting to receive the SUSI Grant please do not be concerned about meeting the September Payment deadline. Your grant does not cover the Student Centre Levy of €254. You will need to pay for this yourself.

UCD will only send an invoice to an employer if the employer has a specific contract set up with UCD (HSE or other third-level Irish institutions). In lieu of an invoice, students can print out their fee statement from SISWeb to give to an employer. (Please see the section \"\" for further details on accessing your fee statement.) If your funding body rejects your fee statement, please check with your School/College Office if it is possible to request an invoice.

What is the difference between a Statement of Results and a Transcript? An Academic Transcript lists your complete academic history, including programme attended, a breakdown of marks/grades achieved, the degree awarded, your overall grade & conferring date. Transcripts are only available to students who have completed their programme. A Statement of Results lists the marks/grades achieved in each module for a specific exam period (i.e. per year or per trimester). Your Statement of Results is available to you after you complete each trimester. The Statement of Results is the document that you should use if you have not yet completed your programme & are asked to provide proof of your results to date (ie. for an internship, a post-graduate application, etc.). Why do my results say pending? During the Grade Approvals Process at the end of each term, UCD Registry is required to temporarily block access to students’ Statements of Results from the current year and, in many cases, the previous years. When access to results is blocked, \"pending\" will appear in place of your module grades. Your Statement of Results will return to normal once the final results for the term have been released.

Registration Open All Close All Can I drop a module when online registration is 'closed'? Your college office can drop modules after online registration closes in SISWeb. Online registration closes for all students on 6 Feb 2024 at 17:00 *You should drop unwanted Spring modules by 29 March 2024* Drop any modules by 29 March 2024 to avoid being charged. If you withdraw from a module after 29 March 2024, you will still be charged for that module in the 2023/24 academic year No additional fee will apply if you retake the same module again the following year. You can withdraw from a module before the last day of teaching in a trimester, with no academic implications. An automatic withdrawn grade (WN) will go onto your record should you withdraw after 29 March 2024. Potential progression issues may arise should you withdraw from modules late in the trimester so always check with your College Office. SUSI grant students should contact the Student Desk before dropping modules so we can explain possible financial implications. Note, the Student Desk is not authorized to drop/swap or register modules, please contact your College/School Office . What are extenuating circumstances & how do I apply? Extenuating circumstances are serious, unforeseen circumstances beyond your control (serious illness, family bereavement, etc) that prevent you from meeting the requirements of your programme. If you are unable to complete assignments or attend required classes/exams due to unforeseen circumstances, you can apply for extenuating circumstances. If you are granted extenuating circumstances in a module, you will have the opportunity to retake this module in the following trimester for no additional cost and with no cap applied to your GPA. Before you apply for extenuating circumstances, it is important that you seek guidance & support from your College/School Office and/or Student Advisor. If you are unsure of who to speak to about applying for extenuating circumstances, please Ask Us . Don't forget to check out our Extenuating Circumstances webpage for helpful information and instructions on how to apply.

If you have any questions about how your fees may be affected by extenuating circumstances, please Ask Us. What is a substitute module? If you fail a module & do not want to repeat/resit the module, you can choose to replace this module with a brand new module (substitute module).

SUSI grant students should contact the Student Desk before dropping modules Note, the Student Desk is not authorized to drop/swap or register modules, please contact your College/School Office . College/School Office What are extenuating circumstances & how do I apply? Extenuating circumstances are serious, unforeseen circumstances beyond your control (serious illness, family bereavement, etc) that prevent you from meeting the requirements of your programme. If you are unable to complete assignments or attend required classes/exams due to unforeseen circumstances, you can apply for extenuating circumstances. If you are granted extenuating circumstances in a module, you will have the opportunity to retake this module in the following trimester for no additional cost and with no cap applied to your GPA. Before you apply for extenuating circumstances, it is important that you seek guidance & support from your College/School Office and/or Student Advisor. If you are unsure of who to speak to about applying for extenuating circumstances, please Ask Us . Don't forget to check out our Extenuating Circumstances webpage for helpful information and instructions on how to apply. In many programmes you can apply for extenuating circumstances online via SISWeb by following the steps below: Log into SISWeb Click on the Programme Services tab Select Applications for Extenuating Circumstances Start a new application & complete all necessary fields Before making an application, please read UCD's Extenuating Circumstances Policy carefully Please note that some programmes require students to complete a different application than the one available on SISWeb. Before completing an application via SISWeb, please speak with your College/School Office to confirm which application form to use. If you make an application for extenuating circumstances and would like an update on the status of your application, please contact your College/School Office as they will be best able to assist you. How fees are affected by extenuating circumstances: If you are granted extenuating circumstances in a module, you will be charged for that module in the year that you initially registered for it. You will not be charged for that module when you retake it in a subsequent trimester. For example, if you register for a module in 2022/2023 but due to extenuating circumstances must retake the module in 2023/2024, you will be charged for this module in 2022/2023 & not in 2023/2024. If you have any questions about how your fees may be affected by extenuating circumstances, please Ask Us.",

UCD Micro-credential website Exams Open All Close All When are the end of term exams and when are results released? Please refer to the Assessment Key Dates How do I view my results? A. To find out the date that final results are released, refer to the question \" When are the end of term exams and when are results released?\" . On the day that results are released, you'll be sent a secure, personalised link that will bring you directly to your results page. This link will only work on the day that results are released. From the day after the results are released, you can access your results in SISWeb by going to \"Registration, Fees & Assessment > My Examination Results\". If you need to access documentation of your results, you can do so on SISWeb , the day after the results are released, by going to \"Registration, Fees & Assessment > My Official Documents > Electronic documents\". Can I check a hold on my record? If you have a hold on your record, you may not be able to access your exam results. The most common holds to be applied to a student's record are as follows: Fee Hold: If you're a continuing student and owe more than €600 at the end of the academic year, a hold will be put on your record which will prevent you from seeing your results. If you're a final year student you must have a €0 balance at the end of the academic year, otherwise a hold will be put on your record which will prevent you from seeing your results and prevent you from graduating. Document Verification Hold: If you have not submitted appropriate documentation for Qualification Check, a hold will be put on your record which will prevent you from seeing your results and if you are a final year student, prevent you from graduating. You can check to see if you have any holds on your record at any time in SISWeb. Navigate to \"Registration, Fees and Assessment > Active Holds on my Record\". Please note the \"Active Holds on my Record\" section will only be visible if you have a hold. If you don't see \"Active Holds on my Record\" within Registration, Fees & Assessment, it means you don't currently have any holds on your record. However, as holds are applied at various times in the year, it is advisable to check throughout the year, to see if any holds have been applied. If you have a hold on your record, & don't know why, AskUs . What is the difference between a repeat and a resit? If you fail a module, you will have the option to either resit it or repeat it in the following trimester. Repeat: If you repeat a module, it is essentially like you are taking the module again for the first time. You will attend all lectures/tutorials/labs for the module & will participate in any/all continuous assessment throughout the trimester. Repeat modules will show up in your trimester timetable. Resit: If you resit a module you will not attend lectures/tutorial/labs and will only take part in the assessment of the module. The assessment can take various forms depending on the module that you are resitting (multiple choice exam, paper, etc) so students should contact the module coordinator to find out exactly what the resit assessment will involve & when the assessment will take place. Resit modules do not show up on your trimester timetable. As of 2023/24, there is no fee for a resit module. The cost for a repeat is €230 per module. When you resit a module, the highest grade that you can receive in that module is capped at a GPA of 2.0. If you repeat a module, your grade point will be reduced by 0.6. For example, an \"A\" in a first attempt module is 4.0 grade points while an \"A\" in a repeat module is 3.4 points. Check out the Remediation page for a full breakdown of the Grade Points associated with each remediation type. More information can be found on the Repeats/Resits/Withdrawn modules page. For a detailed step-by-step guide, watch our video Registering to Repeats, Resits & Previously Withdrawn Modules here and also our video Failing a module in UCD - What you need to do here.

Please refer to our Past Papers page for further details. How do I appeal a grade? If you have any concerns you should make them known to your Module Coordinator and/or Head of Subject Area or School. If an error is identified the School has the authority to make the necessary changes, thereby removing the need to submit an appeal. Most queries can be satisfactorily resolved at this stage.

When you resit a module, the highest grade that you can receive in that module is capped at a GPA of 2.0.  If you repeat a module,<span> your grade point will be reduced by 0.6. For example, an \"A\" in a first attempt module is 4.0 grade points while an \"A\" in a repeat module is 3.4 points.

If you're a final year student you must have a €0 balance at the end of the academic year, otherwise a hold will be put on your record which will prevent you from seeing your results and prevent you from graduating. Document Verification Hold: If you have not submitted appropriate documentation for Qualification Check, a hold will be put on your record which will prevent you from seeing your results and if you are a final year student, prevent you from graduating. You can check to see if you have any holds on your record at any time in SISWeb. Navigate to \"Registration, Fees and Assessment > Active Holds on my Record\". Please note the \"Active Holds on my Record\" section will only be visible if you have a hold. If you don't see \"Active Holds on my Record\" within Registration, Fees & Assessment, it means you don't currently have any holds on your record.

If you have a hold on your record, & don't know why, AskUs . AskUs What is the difference between a repeat and a resit? If you fail a module, you will have the option to either resit it or repeat it in the following trimester. Repeat: If you repeat a module, it is essentially like you are taking the module again for the first time. You will attend all lectures/tutorials/labs for the module & will participate in any/all continuous assessment throughout the trimester. Repeat modules will show up in your trimester timetable. Resit: If you resit a module you will not attend lectures/tutorial/labs and will only take part in the assessment of the module. The assessment can take various forms depending on the module that you are resitting (multiple choice exam, paper, etc) so students should contact the module coordinator to find out exactly what the resit assessment will involve & when the assessment will take place. Resit modules do not show up on your trimester timetable. As of 2023/24, there is no fee for a resit module. The cost for a repeat is €230 per module. When you resit a module, the highest grade that you can receive in that module is capped at a GPA of 2.0. If you repeat a module, your grade point will be reduced by 0.6. For example, an \"A\" in a first attempt module is 4.0 grade points while an \"A\" in a repeat module is 3.4 points. Check out the Remediation page for a full breakdown of the Grade Points associated with each remediation type. More information can be found on the Repeats/Resits/Withdrawn modules page.

If an error is identified the School has the authority to make the necessary changes, thereby removing the need to submit an appeal. Most queries can be satisfactorily resolved at this stage. If you are dissatisfied with the response from the School and if you have valid grounds for appeal you can raise your concerns via the formal assessment appeals process. You must wait until the final results have been published before you can appeal a grade.
