## UCD HR Approval date and body UMT, 26 September 2023

## 1. Purpose

Secondments within UCD provide opportunities for staff development by allowing staff members to enhance existing skills and develop new skills to support individual career development. UCD supports secondments within the University where it is deemed to be beneficial for the University, the School/Unit (where the substantive post exists) and the staff member.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all UCD Staff members (both permanent and fixed term) who apply for another post/role on a temporary basis within UCD. Staff members must have completed their probationary period before applying for a secondment.

## Secondments to a Fixed-Term Post

All permanent and fixed-term staff members are eligible to apply for any alternative fixed term posts, as and when advertised within UCD.

## Permanent Employees

Should the appointee be an existing permanent staff member, appointment to this alternate UCD post will be treated as an internal secondment and the employee's permanent status will not be affected.

Where a secondment is less than 2 years duration, the substantive post of a permanent employee will be retained for them (unless cumulative secondment contracts exceed 2 years whereby the substantive post will be treated as below). At the end of the secondment the permanent employee will return to their substantive post and grade subject to the conditions set out in this policy.

In the case of secondments of greater than 2 years duration, the substantive post of a permanent employee will not be retained. At the end of the secondment the employee will return to their substantive grade but will not necessarily go back to their home School/Unit. Assigned duties and responsibilities will be consistent with their grade.

The College Principal/Vice-President has responsibility for finding the employee a new role. However, the ultimate assignment may be outside their home College/School/Unit. Please see the conditions set out in Principles, Section 4.5 of this policy.

## Fixed-Term Employees

Should the appointee be an existing fixed-term staff member, appointment to the alternate UCD post will supersede their existing fixed-term post assuming that the duration of this new appointment exceeds that of the existing post.

Note: In the unlikely event that an appointment is of a lesser duration, the individual has no entitlement to return to their former fixed-term post.

## 4. Principles

## 4.1. Advertising Posts

All posts must be advertised for a minimum of 10 working days. Advertised posts are filled by open competition subject to the guidelines set out in the Recruitment and Selection Policy. A reference will be collected from their current line manager where the employee is moving outside their home unit.

## 4.2 Notification and Approval

Employees are encouraged to inform their manager when applying for another post within the university.

Managers must facilitate employees taking up a temporary secondment within UCD and cannot refuse to release a member of their staff if they have been successful in their application. The timeframe for release is a minimum of 4 weeks notice up to a maximum of 8 weeks notice.

Managers (ie. the manager of the substantive post and the manager of the secondment post) are encouraged to discuss the release timeframe and agree on a date which is mutually acceptable and meets the needs of the school or unit taking account of the timelines above.

## 4.3 Compensation

Salary will be paid in accordance with the grade of the new post.

- If the secondee is already at the grade of the new post then no salary increase will occur at the time of appointment and annual increments will apply.
- If the secondee is moving to a new grade for the duration of the secondment then they will move to the appropriate scale and to the first point above their current salary

Secondees will maintain their continuous service, annual leave record at that time and will be subject to the terms and conditions of the secondment post.

On returning to the substantive grade, the secondee's salary will revert to previous levels but including any increments or national pay awards which may have occurred during the secondment.

## 4.4 Contracts and Acceptance

A new contractual letter will be drafted by UCD HR which will be issued to the employee before accepting a temporary secondment. This will clearly highlight to permanent employees that:

a) Their permanent status with UCD will not be affected.

b) The substantive post will not be retained for them for more than 2 years as outlined in Principles, section 4.5.

Once the contractual letter is accepted and signed by the employee there is no option for the employee to return to their substantive post before the agreed end date.

Equally the manager of the secondment post cannot terminate the arrangement before the agreed end date in the contractual letter.

## 4.5 End of Secondment

## 4.5.1 Secondments of less than 2 years duration

The substantive post of a permanent employee will be retained for them (unless cumulatively the contracts exceed 2 years whereby the substantive post will be treated as below). At the end of the secondment the permanent employee will return to their substantive post and grade.

If the substantive post no longer exists, the permanent employee will return to a post of the same grade in the college/School/ or Unit where their substantive post existed.

## 4.5.2 Secondments of greater than 2 years duration

The substantive post of a permanent employee will not be retained for any period once the employee has accepted the terms of the secondment contract. At the end of the secondment the employee will return to their substantive grade. It will be the responsibility of the College Principal/Vice-President of the home Unit which held the secondee's original substantive post to find the employee a suitable new role within their home College/School/Unit or in some other College/School/Unit within the University.

In a scenario where a secondment of initially less than 2 years extends to be greater than 2 years, the unit will have the option of completing a review to fill the role on a permanent basis via open competition, in this scenario the permanent employee will return to a post of the same grade in the college/School/ or Unit where their substantive post existed upon completion of their extended secondment.
