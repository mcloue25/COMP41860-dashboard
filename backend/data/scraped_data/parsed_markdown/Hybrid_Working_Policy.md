## Hybrid Working Policy

## Policy owner UCD Human Resources Approval date and body 29 April 2025 UMT

## 1. Purpose

Hybrid  working  is  a  type  of  flexible  working  arrangement  where  employees  spend  a proportion  of  their  working  time  on-campus or associated sites (their contractual place of work) and some of their working time from an agreed remote working location. Where an employee and role are deemed eligible for hybrid working in accordance with this policy  and  the  request  has  been  approved (in accordance with section 4.3), it is expected that employees will work a minimum of three days on-campus per week. The facility to request hybrid working is being made available to support UCD's ambition to be  an  'Employer  and  University  of  Choice'  and  seeks  to  maximise  benefits  for  work-life balance,  health,  wellbeing  and  sustainability  while  ensuring  the  successful  delivery  of  all aspects of the University's mission and the optimisation of our vibrant campus experience. This policy forms part of a wider range of documentation to support hybrid working, such as Criteria  and  Eligibility  Guidelines  for  Hybrid  Working,  Hybrid  Working  Requests  Procedure and Health and Safety guidance (which can be found on the UCD SIRC website). This policy has been developed in accordance with the Work Life Balance  and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2023 and the WRC Code of Practice on the Right to Request

Remote Working.

## 2. Scope

## 2.1 Eligibility for Hybrid Working Arrangements

- As UCD is a campus-based University, there are many roles in the University that will not be suitable for hybrid working.
- It  is  acknowledged  that  faculty  members  have  always had the option to carry out certain  duties  by  way  of  hybrid  working  arrangements.  This  is  due  to the nature of their  work,  which  may  involve  field  work,  access  to  research  facilities  and  other

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

off-site  activities.  These  working  arrangements  pre-date  the  UCD  Hybrid  Working Trial and will continue to apply, with Heads of School agreeing working arrangements with faculty members in line with the needs of their School, workload model and the key principles in section 4.1.2.

- Faculty wishing to continue to avail of hybrid working arrangements should submit the online request form via the online portal to comply with the health and safety provisions (in line with section 5.4) and outline their remote work location.
- All other employees who wish to avail of hybrid working must request it via the online portal (subject to section 4.3).
- There is no service requirement to request a hybrid working arrangement (subject to section 2.4)
- Heads  of  School/Unit/Line  managers  can approve hybrid working requests (where eligible) for a minimum of three days per week on-campus.
- Approved hybrid working requests, while normally continuous, are not an indefinite arrangement. Hybrid working arrangements should be considered as part of annual staff  planning  or  more  frequently  as  required,  to  ensure  that  the  arrangement  is working successfully for both the University and the employee.

## 2.2 Probation

Employees on probation may be considered for hybrid working. However, the probationary period is designed to integrate the new employee into the University and their role, and their manager may not be able to facilitate hybrid working during some periods due to:

- The employee having to avail of additional supports to help them settle into their new role with peers and colleagues.
- Assisting with adapting to their new role and work environment.
- Facilitating  ongoing  engagement,  team  bonding  and  collaboration  with  managers and with team members.
- Facilitating in person meetings and training where required and/or to assist with the assessment of the probationer's performance.

## 2.3 Terms and Conditions of Employment

There will be no change to terms and conditions of employment as part of a hybrid working arrangement, except that the employee will be facilitated to work remotely as agreed with their direct manager and in line with the key principles (section 4.1).

## 2.4. Exceptional Requests

Any request for a remote working arrangement, whether full or partial, that deviates from the approved University hybrid working policy (i.e. minimum of three days on-campus per week) are categorised as an 'exceptional request for remote work'.

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

All employees have the right to make a statutory request for remote working in accordance with the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2023 and the WRC Code of Practice (Right to Request Remote Work). There is no automatic right to remote working and consideration is on a case-by-case basis approved only in exceptional circumstances, in line with the principles outlined in the policy. Approval of the direct line manager and authorisation by Head of School/Unit and a relevant UMT member is required. Where exceptional requests for remote work are approved, six months' service is required before the working arrangement can commence.

## 2.5 Reasonable Accommodation

Recommendations  for  hybrid  or  fully  remote  working  arrangements based on reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability is outside the scope of this policy and will be dealt with under the reasonable accommodation and disability support process.

## 3. Definitions

## 3.1 Hybrid Working

Hybrid  working  is  a  type  of  flexible  working  arrangement  where  employees  spend  a proportion  of  their  working  time  on-campus or associated sites (their contractual place of work) and some of their working time from an agreed remote working location.

## 3.2 Remote Working Location

In the context of UCD, the remote working location will be a location other than the campus and  associated  sites,  typically  the  employee's  home,  based  on an expressed agreement between the employee and their manager. The University campuses and associated work sites/locations will continue to be the primary workplace for all employees.

## 3.3 Approvers

Members of UMT, Heads of School/Unit/Line Managers or nominees have the authority to review and consider hybrid working requests and arrangements on an ongoing basis.

## 4. Principles

## 4.1 Key principles

## 4.1.1 Approval

- UCD  is  a  campus-based  university  that  prioritises  the  delivery  of  outstanding education and research and a vibrant student, faculty and  staff  community experience.
- Hybrid  working  must not negatively impact the delivery of an individual's role. The needs  and  objectives  of  the  University  are  given  priority  over  requests  for  hybrid working,  given  the  critical  national  and  global  mission  universities  fulfil  for  society. Accordingly, many roles within the University will not be suitable for hybrid working.
- Student-facing  services  on-campus  should  be  open  and  available  for  all  of  the working week.
- In  cases  where  hybrid  working  arrangements are approved, in order to protect all aspects  of  on-campus  vibrancy,  including  the  student  experience,  availability  of services,  on-the-job  learning,  building  a  positive  culture  and  sharing  of  ideas, employees will spend more of their time working on-campus than working remotely.
- Where  hybrid  working  is  approved  for  a  full-time  role,  the  portion  of  time  spent working on-campus will be a minimum of three days per week (subject to section 4.2 below). There will be an appropriate pro-rata amount for those working part time.
- Approvers  and  employees  requesting  hybrid working  are  required  to  engage constructively  to  consider  how  this  working  arrangement  might  be  implemented, mindful  of  university,  team  and  individual  roles  and  allied  with  the  provision  of excellent services in the context of the principles set out in this policy.
- Requests  for  hybrid  working  will  be  submitted  and  considered  in  a  transparent environment of mutual trust and accountability for individual roles and responsibilities.
- In  situations  where  a  request for hybrid working cannot be approved, the employee will be provided with the rationale for the decision.

## 4.1.2 Implementation

- Where  an  employee  is  engaged  in hybrid working, there is the potential that their current campus space may change or may be used by others in support of optimising space efficiency.
- It  is  expected  that  employees  engaging  in  hybrid  working  will  attend  the  campus when required to do so with reasonable notice provided.
- Employees will be supported with appropriate digital technology to be successful in achieving an integrated working environment. Continuous technological advancements will be embraced and utilised to support connectivity whether working on-campus or remotely.
- While  working  off-campus  as  part  of  a  hybrid  arrangement,  employees  will  be available  by  phone  /  email  throughout  working  hours  just as if  they  were  working on-campus.
- All  employees  will  adhere  to  the  UCD  core  meeting  hours  policy  and  remain cognisant of the right to disconnect outside working hours.
- Employees must be within a reasonable commutable distance of campus.
- All University policies, procedures and statutes apply during hybrid working arrangements. These policies specify legislative and regulatory requirements, along with University norms and expectations.
- The focus of all involved in a hybrid working arrangement will be on the delivery of excellent  work  outputs  in  an  environment of trust, accountability, collaboration and community spirit, regardless of physical location.
- Employees approved for hybrid working will be treated equally in an inclusive work environment, with no detriment attached to working flexibly in this manner.
- This policy will be kept under review, taking into account organisational learnings and relevant external developments, and may be subject to change.

## 4.2 Types of Hybrid Working Arrangements

There is no 'one way' for hybrid working arrangements. The working arrangement should be discussed and agreed between the individual and their line manager in the context of service needs and role requirements. The operational needs of the School or Unit will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the request and the level of on-campus requirements will depend on each particular area of work.

Approvers have the discretion to consider hybrid working requests over the full calendar year in order to allow flexibility for some roles.

A hybrid working arrangement may include the following;

- Specific rostered days on-campus each week as required for the School or Unit to deliver effectively for the University community.
- Some  roles  are  not  rostered  and  flexibility  is  required.  These  roles  will  operate  a minimum of three days on-campus per week and there may be flexibility around the specific days depending on the requirements of the role.
- Services where full on-campus presence is required only at certain times of the year may  be  suitable  for  hybrid  working  outside  those  times.  For  those  roles,  off-peak

hybrid  working  may  be  considered  by  the  Head  of  School/Unit/Line  Manager depending on the requirements of the School or Unit.

- Cross  cover  as  required  to  ensure  delivery  of  on-campus  services,  e.g.  to  cover periods  of  annual  leave  or  unforeseen  sick  leave  that  impact  the  team.  This collegiality and flexibility will benefit all colleagues in the round.

## 4.3 Considering Requests for Hybrid Working

Requests will be considered having regard to:

- University needs;
- Student needs;
- Role suitability;
- Employee needs and suitability;
- Designated workspace requirements; and
- The requirements of the WRC Code of Practice (Right to Request Remote Work).

The requests will be considered in an objective, fair and reasonable manner in accordance with the key principles and Criteria and Eligibility Guidelines, which will take into account the suitability  of  the  role  for  hybrid  working  as  well  as  the  employee  suitability  for  a  hybrid arrangement.

## 4.4 Changes to a Hybrid Working Arrangement

The employee and the approver can agree (subject to section 2.4) in writing a change to an agreed working arrangement, before or after it has started, which can include:

- Postponing the arrangement or part of it to an agreed date;
- Curtailing the period of the arrangement; or
- Varying the arrangement in an agreed way.

## 4.5 Continuing Assessment of Suitability for Hybrid Working

Hybrid working arrangements should be considered as part of annual staff planning or more frequently as required, to ensure that the arrangement is working successfully for both the University and the employee.

If performance  issues  arise,  these  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  established University procedures for such matters.

## 4.6 Termination of Arrangements

The approver can terminate an approved hybrid working arrangement in certain circumstances. The termination process is outlined in the Criteria and Eligibility Guidelines for Hybrid Working Requests. In  any  case,  fair  process  will  prevail  and  reasonable  notice  of  termination  of  the  working arrangement will be given. The reasons why the working arrangement will be terminated will be  provided  in  writing  and  the  employee  will  have  the  opportunity  to  respond  before  a decision is made to proceed. Where  possible,  the  approver  will  engage  with  the  employee  to  consider  whether  any alternative  arrangements other than termination of the hybrid working arrangement may be feasible depending on the circumstances. If the decision is to proceed with termination of the arrangement, the employee must revert to their primary workplace by the date stated in the notice. Failure to adhere to the notice issued may result in disciplinary action. The employee can also request a termination of the hybrid working arrangement by writing to their line manager with the proposed date to revert to their primary workplace.

## 4.7 Moving to a New Role

When  an  employee  moves  to  a  new  role, they do not retain their current hybrid working arrangement and a new request will need to be considered by the relevant approver. This is to  ensure  optimum service levels are maintained whilst supporting the capacity for hybrid working for team members.

## 4.8 Abuse of Hybrid Working Arrangement

All employees must continue to meet all the requirements of their role while they are working remotely. If  there  are  reasonable  grounds for believing an employee is not fulfilling all the requirements of their role, they may be given reasonable notice of termination of the hybrid working  arrangement  setting  out  the  reasons  for  termination  and  specifying  the  date  on which the employee must return to on-campus working. The  process  is  outlined  in  the  Eligibility  and  Criteria  Guidelines  for  Hybrid  Working document.

## 4.9 Penalisation

Employees will not be penalised for making a request for hybrid working and/or requesting to return to a previous working arrangement.

## 4.10 Raising Concerns

Concerns in relation to hybrid working requests or the consideration of the request, should in the first instance be discussed with the Head of School/Unit/Line Manager, with the support of the HR Partner, where necessary.

If the matter is not resolved, the UCD Grievance Policy and Procedure may be utilised.

## 4.11 Record Keeping

Records for hybrid working will be kept for a period of three years from the commencement of the arrangement and will include the following information:

- the period of employment of each employee,
- the dates on which each employee was on an approved hybrid working arrangement, and
- the number of times each employee was on an approved  hybrid working arrangement.

In  cases where the hybrid working arrangement has been approved and is continuous, the records will be kept for the duration of the approved working arrangement.

Copies of termination notices will be kept for a period of 12 months.

Hybrid working requests that have not been approved will be kept for a period of 12 months.

The  retention  period  can  be  increased  where  it  is  deemed  appropriate and  necessary to keep a record of the hybrid working arrangement, request or termination notice for a longer period than stated.
