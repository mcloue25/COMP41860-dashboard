## Academic Integrity Policy

Policy owner Office of the Registrar

## 1. Purpose

## 1.1 Introduction

Academic integrity requires every member of the academic community at UCD to act ethically, honestly and fairly. A lack of academic integrity in any sphere of university activity undermines the credibility and value of all that UCD does and of the awards that it makes to students.  Every member of the UCD community shares responsibility for upholding the academic integrity values that underpin our scholarly practice  in  teaching,  research,  and  student  learning;  activities  that  underpin  the  foundations  of  our intellectual community at University College Dublin.

This policy has been developed through consultation with faculty, students and the wider community of stakeholders  in  the  university.    It  reflects  current  research  and  best  practice  nationally  and internationally in academic integrity in higher education.  In particular, this policy is informed by relevant national  legislation 1   and  is  consistent  with  the  principles  and  guidelines  produced  by  the  National Academic Integrity Network (NAIN), including the National Principle and Common Lexicon of Terms for academic integrity  (NAIN,  2021);  the  National  Academic  Integrity  Guidelines  (NAIN,  2021)  and  the National Framework for Academic Misconduct Investigation and Case Management (NAIN, 2023).

UCD is committed to supporting faculty and students in embedding and nurturing a culture in which academic integrity flourishes and in which breaches of academic integrity are promptly, efficiently and appropriately addressed according to their severity.

## 1.2 Values

This  policy  is  underpinned  by  the  values  of  Honesty,  Trust,  Fairness,  Respect,  Responsibility,  and Courage as identified by the International Center for Academic Integrity and articulated by the National Academic Integrity Network (NAIN). 2

## 1.3 Objectives

This  policy  reflects  the  University's  commitment  to  supporting  and  promoting  academic  integrity through:

- a) the development of a collective culture of responsibility around academic integrity fostered by all faculty, staff and students.

1 Section 43A of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education &amp; Training) Act, 2012 - Offence to provide or advertise cheating services.

2 As identified by the International Center for Academic Integrity and articulated by the National Academic Integrity Network (NAIN, 2021, p. 4).  The full text of the ICAI Values of Academic Integrity is accessible from: 20019\_ICAI-Fundamental-Values\_R12.pdf (academicintegrity.org)

## Approval date and body

Academic Council Executive Committee, May 2024 Effective 1 September 2024

- b) a clear framework of education, prevention, detection, sanctioning and record keeping so that UCD can both mitigate and respond appropriately to academic misconduct.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all individuals engaged in academic work at UCD.

This Academic Integrity Policy is intended as a holistic and supportive statement that reflects the values of academic integrity upheld by students, faculty and staff in UCD. It not only outlines the University's expectations of students in relation to their assessed work, but also the various roles and responsibilities of faculty, staff and units in supporting students in their learning. It reflects sectoral developments by defining  clearly  certain  academic  misconduct  behaviours.  This  policy  complements  the  University's Research  Integrity  Policy.  Both  policies  detail  their  application  to  research  vs.  taught  students,  as follows:

In relation to research it is expected that allegations relating to minor research assignments undertaken by students on taught programmes will generally be handled in the first instance under the Academic Integrity Policy, and its related procedures, and/or the UCD Student Code of Conduct. However, on either taught or research programmes, when allegations of academic misconduct are made in respect of research that appears in the published literature, is externally funded or is otherwise of a significance that merits handling through the UCD Procedure for the Investigation of Misconduct in Research, that latter procedure will be invoked. The Registrar or their nominee, following consultation with the Vice President for Research Innovation and Impact will decide which policy will take precedence in individual cases.

Unless otherwise stated, this policy applies in the context of collaborative, linked or shared provision and in all modules offered through such provision.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

## 3.1 The University

The University sets standards of academic integrity and in this document sets out the definitions of academic misconduct. It also puts in place arrangements to:

- a) Enable  students to understand  and  observe  academic  integrity  and  avoid  academic misconduct;
- b) Inform and educate students about the policy for unacceptable practices in academic writing and assessment; and
- c) Use electronic and other detection mechanisms, such as text-matching software, to identify instances of potential academic misconduct.

## 3.2 UCD Library

UCD Library provides education about, and promotes University policy on, academic integrity.

## 3.3 Schools

Schools arrange for students to receive advice and guidance on correct citation and referencing, on avoiding academic misconduct, and on the potential consequences of academic misconduct.

## 3.4 Heads of School

Heads of School develop and periodically review a School Academic Misconduct Protocol. 3   Heads of School also ensure that appropriate and timely student advisory arrangements are in place to promote academic integrity in the subject area(s) and to educate students about avoiding academic misconduct.

## 3.5 Module Coordinators

Module Coordinators ensure that their students are briefed on avoiding academic misconduct in the context of their module, prior to the students submitting assessments or taking examinations. Module Coordinators will, via the module descriptor, provide students with information on:

- i. Expectations for citation methods in that module;
- ii. Whether the use of generative artificial intelligence, or other machine learning technology, is permitted.

## 3.6 Research Supervisors

Research supervisors ensure that their students are briefed on avoiding academic misconduct in the context of their research work.

## 3.7 Students

Students ensure that they maintain academic integrity in all their learning and in the work completed by them. It is the responsibility of all students to:

- a) act honestly and with integrity in all academic matters;
- b) review the educative materials provided and complete any self-assessment as directed;
- c) familiarise themselves with the expectations outlined in the module descriptor for each of their modules; and,
- d) complete, where required, a declaration statement confirming compliance with this policy.

## 3.8 Additional Responsibilities

All  parties  must  comply  with  the  responsibilities  outlined  in  both  this  policy  and  in  the  University's Student Academic Misconduct Procedure .

## 4. Principles

The University  upholds  the  principle  of  academic  integrity  and  expects  students  to  ensure  that  the intellectual efforts of others are acknowledged correctly in any material submitted for assessment.

## 4.1 Supporting Academic Integrity

All faculty / tutors / instructors are encouraged to educate students about academic integrity and to develop an open culture in which faculty, staff and students champion academic integrity. Supporting students in developing their learning and critical thinking is key and is formed within their disciplinary /

3 See Student Academic Misconduct Procedure

subject contexts. It is important that information about academic integrity is shared appropriately and acted upon so that:

- the University's expectations of students in terms of academic integrity are clearly set out and easily accessible.
- the definitions of academic misconduct are explained as per this policy.
- the  module  descriptors  set  out  expectations  regarding  academic  integrity  for  each  specific module;
- students are directed towards materials regarding academic integrity through the provision of links to policies and other materials.

## 4.2 Course Work

Faculty / tutors / instructors are encouraged to set clear expectations in relation to course work and assessment tasks and indicate, for example, whether or not:

- a) collaborative work is permissible or encouraged in any assessment task;
- b) the extent of collaboration that is allowed in that assessment task; and
- c) whether the use of Generative AI is permissible and under what conditions.

Module Coordinators should inform students about UCD's text-based similarity detecting software. It is at the discretion of the Module Coordinator to allow students to have access to the results of the detection software.

## 4.3 Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Technologies

If permissible (by faculty/tutor/instructor) and when used appropriately, generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools can offer support across various aspects of the learning process. However, outputs from these tools must always be considered in the same manner as work created by another person/persons i.e. used critically, ethically, cited and acknowledged appropriately.

This academic integrity policy prohibits students from representing work as their own that they did not write, code or create.  Accordingly, submission of  AI-generated content without explicit permission and attribution is not allowed.

Given the diversity of disciplines and subjects across the university, faculty / tutors / instructors may use generative AI in different ways to support student learning.  Acknowledging this:

- It should be indicated clearly in the module descriptor whether generative AI will form any part of the learning experience.
- All  faculty  /  tutors  /  instructors  may  allow  the  use  of  generative  AI  to  complete  specific assignments.
- Specific guidance based on disciplinary expectations should be provided to students in the use of generative AI where it is permitted.
- Students are expected to follow each step of that guidance and properly acknowledge the use of generative AI in each aspect of their submitted work.
- If a student has any doubt about whether a specific use of generative AI is permitted for an assignment or course, they are responsible for discussing it with the faculty member / tutor / instructor prior to using it.
- Students  must  indicate  clearly  in  submitted  work  the  nature  and  extent  of  any  outside assistance  (including  the  use  of  professional  tutors,  machine  learning  or  AI  technologies) according to the citation practices set out by the relevant subject/discipline.

## 4.4 Assessment

Module Coordinators should pay careful attention to the design of their assessment so that students are clear about what is required both within the assessment and to avoid academic misconduct. Module Coordinators are encouraged to:

- a) Review  the  assessment  for  each  module  every  time  the  module  is  offered  and  redesign assessment tasks to discourage recurrence of any previously identified academic misconduct.
- b) Where possible, not reuse assessment tasks in a way that enables students with knowledge or prior experience of those tasks to gain an unfair advantage for themselves or others.
- c) Where possible, not reuse examination questions and assignment questions except when the Module Coordinator is satisfied that reuse will not:
- i. jeopardise the academic integrity of the assessment; or
- ii. create unfair advantage.
- d) For  MCQ-type  assessment,  adopt  design  measures  and  features  to  mitigate  academic misconduct, such as: maintaining a dynamic repository of questions (question bank) to facilitate the creation of unique assessments, randomise and shuffle questions and answers, substitute numeric values, and variety of question type.

The Module Coordinator may stipulate assessment requirements, including but not limited to:

- a) file submission type; and
- b) submission of work-in-progress, including draft documents.

For work that is not a text-based written assignment, such as demonstrations, laboratory work, objective structured  clinical  examinations  (OSCEs)  or  other  skills-based  activities,  Module  Coordinators  are encouraged to take all reasonable steps to design  an assessment that  minimises the possibility of academic misconduct and, as far as possible provides confidence that:

- a) the assignment is the student's own original work;
- b) the work of others is appropriately acknowledged;
- c) the assignment has not been previously submitted; and
- d) the input of others does not exceed the bounds of legitimate cooperation.

## 5. Definitions

Where feasible, and for consistency with practice nationally and internationally, UCD has reflected the definitions identified by the National Academic Integrity Network in its Lexicon of Common Terms.

## 5.1 Academic misconduct

Academic misconduct (also known as academic dishonesty or academic malpractice) 'is any attempt by someone to seek unfair advantage in relation to [an] academic activity or which facilitates others to gain an unfair advantage, or to profit from the sharing or selling of your own or others' work without permission'. 4

4 NAIN, 2021(a), p. 3. Subsequent definitions in this section are taken from the NAIN Lexicon of Common Terms as indicated by quotation marks.

Examples of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to the following practices:

- (a)  Plagiarism : 'Presenting work / ideas taken from other sources without proper acknowledgement.' Plagiarism is a failure to cite or otherwise acknowledge ideas or phrases used in  any paper, exercise, assessment or project submitted in a course but gained from another source, such as a published text, another person's work, or materials on the internet.

Plagiarism includes presenting work for assessment, publication, or otherwise, that:

- i. uses phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or longer extracts from published or unpublished work (including from the internet) without appropriate acknowledgement of the source.
- ii. presents direct extracts without quotation marks or other appropriate indication. It is not sufficient simply to acknowledge the source.
- iii. copies the same or a very similar idea from a published or unpublished work without appropriate acknowledgement.
- iv. changes the order of words taken from source material but retains the original idea or concept without appropriate acknowledgement.
- v. copies or uses, without appropriate acknowledgement, any material from non-written work including, but not limited to, visual and digital media, images, computer code, musical notation, recording or composition, performance or oral presentations

or

- vi. uses the work of another student without appropriate acknowledgement in a way that exceeds the bounds of legitimate cooperation.

Plagiarism is unacceptable in academic work, even where it arises as a result of:

- poor referencing;
- error;
- inability to paraphrase; or
- inhibition about writing in the student's own words.

(b) Self-plagiarism : Reusing one's own work without citing or acknowledging its original use. This could mean submitting one piece of work in more than one course.

(c) Recycling :  The  'practice  of  data  fragmentation  or  salami  slicing  where  the  author(s) separate aspects of a study' or their work. 'Writers should recycle their own material carefully and sparingly.'

(d) Misrepresentation of authorship : The submission of someone else's work (or part thereof) as one's own, when the work (all or in part) has been produced by, or purchased from, another person or party.

(e) Contract cheating : a form of academic misconduct where 'a person uses an undeclared and/or unauthorised third party, online or directly, to assist them to produce work for academic credit or progression, whether or not payment or other favour is involved'. The NAIN Lexicon of Common Terms provides the following examples of contract cheating:

- 'Buying a completed assignment from a tutoring or ghost-writing company (purchasing from online essay mill websites);
- Asking a partner, friend or family member to write part or all of an assignment for you;

- Paying a private tutoring company to coach you on how to complete an assignment;
- Submitting  'model'  assignment  answers  provided  by  a  private  tutor  or  tutoring company;
- Getting someone else to sit an exam for you;
- Sitting an exam for someone else;
- Buying, selling or swapping assignments or assignment answers via 'sharing' websites or social media platforms. E.g., Facebook, TikTok etc.' Six types of prohibited services available to students are:
- i. 'essay writing services;
- ii. friends, family and other students;
- iii. private tutors;
- iv. copyediting services;
- v. agency websites;
- vi. reverse classifieds.'

(f) Collusion or violating the limits of acceptable collaboration in coursework set by a faculty member or School, through 'undisclosed collaboration of two or more people on an assignment or task, which is supposed to be completed individually'. Examples of collusion include, but are not limited to:

- Using another student's work and submitting it for assessment as your own.
- Giving your work to another student to submit as part of their own assessment.
- Co-writing work, without acknowledgment, that will be submitted for assessment.
- Working  with  other  students  without  permission  to  produce  material  that  will  be assessed or to produce responses to assessment questions.
- Using social media / chat rooms message groups to collude during the completion of online assessments.
- Inappropriately assisting another student with the production of an assessment task, including sharing answers or providing drafts or completed copies of an assessment task.
- If a student makes an inequitable contribution to a group assignment and claims credit for the work of others, this is collusion and may be considered as academic misconduct.
- (g)  Fabricating or falsifying data , information or sources of information in coursework or lab work,  or  forms  submitted  to  the  School/Module  Coordinator/Instructor.  This  includes 'Forging  educational,  research  or  scholarship  content,  images,  data,  equipment  or processes in a way that they are inaccurately represented'. And / or 'Making up data and presenting that data as genuine'.

Fabrication or falsification of data or information includes, but is not limited to:

- Misleadingly excluding data from analysis;
- Misinterpreting data to obtain desired results (including the inappropriate use of statistical methods);
- Producing false data or results under pressure from a sponsor;
- Data-related misconduct. Examples include:
- i. 'Not preserving primary data where appropriate';
- ii. 'Withholding data from the scientific community';
- iii. 'Managing and / or storing data badly. The above applies to physical research materials as well.'
- iv. 'Selective citing to enhance importance of findings';
- v. 'Establishing  or  supporting  journals  that  undermine  the  quality  control  of research ('predatory journals')';
- vi. 'Grossly exaggerating the importance and practical applicability of findings'.

- (h)  Facilitating academic dishonesty by  assisting  another  student  to  obtain  an  academic advantage by dishonest or unfair means.
- (i) Fabrication  of  credentials in  materials  submitted  to  the  University  as  part  of  an admissions  application  or  in  materials  submitted  to  the  University  for  administrative  or academic review.
- (j) Inappropriately using digital or information technology to  complete  an  assessment task; i.e., using such technology without explicit permission from relevant academic staff and / or not acknowledging use of such technology when its use is permitted Examples including, but are not limited to:
- i. unauthorised  and  /  or  unacknowledged  use  of  artificial  intelligence  tools  to generate content for assessment purposes; or
- ii. unauthorised  and  /  or  unacknowledged  use  of  paraphrasing  or  translation software to, for example, disguise plagiarism, collusion, contract cheating or other academic integrity breach.

(k)  Inappropriately  publishing,  uploading  or  sharing  an  assessment ,  or  part  of  an assessment, including responses to university assessment questions, to a website, or a filesharing site or other online platform. To publish, upload or share such material without explicit permission from the owner of the material and / or the Module Coordinator may also be a breach of copyright laws.

(l) Inappropriately publishing or uploading University teaching or course material to a website, or a file-sharing site or other online platform. To publish, upload or share such material without explicit permission from the owner of the material and / or the module coordinator may also be a breach of copyright laws.

(m)  Impersonation by  'Undertaking  in  whole  or  in  part  any  work  required  as  part  of  a programme in the place of an enrolled [student], without permission …; Sitting an exam, or having someone else sit an exam in place of an enrolled [student]'.

(n) Ghost-writing or authorship by use of 'a non-named (merited, but not listed) author to write or prepare a text for publication.' Examples of ghost writing include, but are not limited to:

- iii. Writing for or in the name of someone else;
- iv. Assisting in the production of work resulting in unfair advantage to someone else.

(o) Copying or cheating at formal examination :  To give or receive assistance in order to gain an academic advantage. Such assistance may include written material, another person or their  work,  or  any  other  source  during  an  examination  or  test;  or  to  hire  or  attempt  to  hire someone to take your exam for you.

Academic misconduct in relation to formal examinations is identified in the UCD Student Code of Conduct and in the Examination Regulations. Some examples include:

- Copying or cheating at any examination or other assessments, such as an in-trimester test. This includes colluding with others during an online examination. This means seeking the assistance of others, or offering to assist others, during a period in which the examination is taking place.
- Sitting  /  attempting  to  sit  an  examination  under  another  student's  identity  at  any examination or in-trimester test.

- Arranging for someone else to sit an examination under your name / on your behalf.
- Bringing unauthorised notes or other materials into an examination or test.
- Use,  or  attempted  use,  of  a  mobile  phone  or  any  other  unauthorised  electronic  device during an examination or test.
- Removing examination scripts, question papers or other stationery from an examination.
- Any other breach of the examination regulations or any action that  may jeopardise the integrity of an assessment.

## (p) Advertising cheating services and / publishing advertisements for cheating services:

Students  are  prohibited  from  advertising  any  service  which  is  considered  to  be  academic misconduct under this policy (for example selling past papers or providing essay writing or assignment completion services). Students are also prohibited from publishing such advertisements, for example on their social media pages.

## 5.2 Generative Artificial Intelligence

Generative artificial intelligence technologies consist of a range of artificial intelligence (AI) tools that use models based on patterns learned from large quantities of training data to generate new text, audio, or  other  media.  Large  language  models  (LLMs)  are  a  type  of  generative  AI  which  understand  and generate human-like content in response to varied prompts. They are referred to as 'generative' due to capabilities to create a range of content including text, audio, video, image and code by processing and analysing large volumes of data they are pre-trained.

## 6. Academic Integrity and the Classroom Environment

Academic integrity allows students and faculty / tutors / instructors the freedom to build new ideas, knowledge and creative works while respecting and acknowledging the work of others. This principle also extends to the classroom environment and the teaching and learning activities that take place therein.

- If a student wishes to make an independent recording of a classroom session (be that an in-person or virtual session), they must seek the permission of the relevant faculty / tutor / instructor in advance and may only use the recording for the purposes of their own personal study.
- Students with reasonable accommodation retain their right to record material. They will be in a position to show their permission from UCD Access and Lifelong Learning concerning their reasonable accommodation.
- Students must destroy any copy of the recording they hold once this purpose has been met. This will be on completion of the final assessment or when the student leaves the University, whichever is sooner.
- Course materials, including handouts, readings, slides, and attendant materials must be understood  as  the  product  of  faculty/teachers'  intellectual  work,  and  treated  as  their property.

It shall be considered a breach of the UCD Student Code of Conduct for students to use, modify or distribute recordings without the permission of the module coordinator / lecturer including but not limited to:

- copying the recording;
- making copies available to third parties, or the public, by any means;
- renting or lending copies of it to the public, playing it in public or broadcasting it;

A student using, modifying or distributing a recording without permission may be investigated under the UCD Student Discipline Procedure and/or the UCD Student Academic Misconduct Procedure.

The contents of class discussion and breakout rooms may not be circulated outside the classroom, in whole or in part, for non-educational purposes (e.g., on social media) or outside the UCD community. Student activity / discussion within breakout rooms should never be recorded.

## 7. Identifying and Investigating Student Academic Misconduct

As per the national Framework for Academic Misconduct Investigation and Case Management , UCD will 'Investigate suspected [academic integrity] breaches as a lay proceeding, using the standard from civil law, where the 'balance of probabilities' is the relevant test to which allegations must be subjected. The balance of probabilities is based on 'clear and convincing evidence' that it is more likely than not that the allegation is true. This is less demanding than the legal test of 'beyond reasonable doubt'. 5

Any work submitted for assessment may be subject to electronic or other detection procedures.

Where employed, electronic detection software, such as text-based similarity or AI detection software, should  be  used  with  caution  and  regarded  only  as  one  tool  in  assisting  an  examiner  to  make  a judgement about academic misconduct.  Any software used to detect academic misconduct in assessed work must be approved for use by the University.

-  If  academic  misconduct  is  suspected  by  an  examiner,  the  examiner  should  employ  all reasonable means to clarify whether academic misconduct has taken place.
-  Where, as a result of a student's performance in another assessment task within a module or component, an examiner forms the reasonable suspicion that an assessment may not be a student's own unaided work (excluding legitimate cooperation), the examiner must report the matter  consistently with this policy  and  the  procedures  governing  the investigation of academic misconduct and/or student discipline.
-  Computer  and  systems  records,  including  details  of  access  to  the  Virtual  Learning Environment, and other student online activity may be reviewed to identify or substantiate potential academic misconduct.
-  The examiner or Module Coordinator can, after outlining their concerns, require a student to discuss or explain components of their assessment tasks to determine the authenticity of their work.

Any examiner or assessor who reasonably believes that a student has breached academic integrity requirements must report it to the relevant Module Coordinator and/or the person responsible for dealing with academic integrity.
