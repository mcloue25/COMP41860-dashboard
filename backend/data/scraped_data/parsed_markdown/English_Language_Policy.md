## 1. Purpose

University College Dublin (UCD) admits students to programmes from NFQ level 6 to level 10 and at various stages within these programmes. Teaching in UCD is primarily through the medium of English; applicants must demonstrate a high level of competence in the English language to be admitted.

The  purpose  of  this  English  Language  Policy  is  to  outline  UCD's  requirements  and  standards  for evaluating  the  English  language  ability  of  all  those  seeking  admission  to  the  University  and  the University's  English  language  supports  for  international  applicants  and learners. This policy reflects UCD's commitment to transparency, quality, and the academic success of international applicants in their programmes of study.

This policy should be read in conjunction with the University's Admissions Policy 1 , and other policies and procedures relevant to the admissions process. It also supports the University's compliance with the QQI Code of Practice for Provision of Programmes of Higher Education to International Learners. 2
