## CHAPTER 1

## UNIVERSITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, DUBLIN

## AMENDMENT  OF  STATUTE  XCVI (96) OF  UNIVERSITY  COLLEGE  DUBLIN

Statute  XCVI  of  University  College  Dublin,  together  with  all  subsequent statutes affecting the provision of superannuation benefits for the President, the academic  staff  and  the  other  staff  of  University  College,  Dublin,  National University of Ireland, Dublin, shall be read and construed with the modifications now set forth.

1. The  benefits  granted  to  persons  who  joined  the  employment  of  the University  College,  Dublin,  National  University  of  Ireland,  Dublin (hereinafter called "the University") on or after the sixth day of April 1995  are  to  be  modified  in  accordance  with  revisions  introduced  for civil servants and set out in Circular 6/95 issued by the Department of Finance.  Such modifications to benefits shall not apply to persons who, immediately  prior  to  appointment,  were  employed  elsewhere  in  the public  sector  in  a  position  in  respect  of  which  they  were  paying  the Class B, C or D rate of PRSI contribution.  Accordingly a new scheme (hereinafter  called  "the  1995  Contributory  Scheme")  is  hereby  made, which  modifies  the  provisions  of  Chapter  I  of  Statute  XCVI  to  give effect to such amendments, the amending provisions whereof are hereto annexed  as  APPENDIX  I  and  the  entitlement  to  superannuation benefits  of  the  above  mentioned  persons  shall  henceforth  derive  from the said scheme.

2. The making of the 1995 Contributory Scheme renders it necessary also to  adopt  a  further  scheme,  similarly  modified,  for  the  provision  of benefits to spouses and children. Accordingly a new scheme (hereinafter  called  "the  1995  Contributory  Spouses'  and  Children's Pension  Scheme")  is  hereby  made,  which  modifies  the  provisions  of Chapter  II  of  Statute  XCVI,  the  amending  provisions  whereof  are hereto annexed as APPENDIX II and the entitlement of survivors of the aforesaid persons to benefits arising on their death in the service of, or following  retirement  from,  the  University,  shall  derive  from  the  said scheme.
3. Section  2  of  Chapter  I  of  Statute  XCVI  shall  be  amended  by  the addition of the following proviso immediately after the first paragraph thereof and immediately before the existing proviso thereto:

'provided  that  certain  participants  who  transferred  to  the  University from other public sector bodies and whose salaries reflect the contributory  nature  of  their  previous  pension  benefits,  shall  at  the discretion  of  the  University,  be  required  to  pay  contributions  towards the  cost  of  their  pensions  at  such  rate  as  shall  be  determined  by  the University.'

4. Section 5 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI shall be amended by deleting the first sentence thereof and replacing it with the following:

'Out of the income of the College, there shall be paid annually (or at more frequent intervals during the year as the University shall decide) into the Joint Pension Fund a sum of the amount of fifteen per cent of the pensionable stipends, salaries and allowances of all persons holding pensionable appointments in the College, or of posts that may become pensionable.'

5. The  provisions  of  Section  12  of  Chapter  I  of  Statute  XCVI  shall  not apply in respect of any persons appointed by the University on or after the 1st day of January 2004.

6. With effect from the 15th day of December 2001 the words 'which is not less than half the equivalent of full-time service,' shall be deleted from the last paragraph of Section 12 of Part II of Appendix I of Statute XCVI.
7. With effect from the 15th day of December 2001 all references to 'fulltime'  throughout  Statute  XCVI,  with  the  exception  of  the  reference contained in the last paragraph of Section 12 of Part II of Appendix I thereof, shall be deleted.
8. With effect from the 1st day of June 2002 Section 11 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI shall be deleted and replaced by the following:
4. '(a) Pensions  on  retirement  on  grounds  of  age  shall  be  paid  only after two full years of service; and
5. (b) Pensions on retirement on grounds of ill-health or other incapacity  from  infirmity  of  mind  or  body  shall  be  paid  only after five full years of service.'
9. With effect from the 1st day of June 2002 the words 'at least five years pensionable service' in Section 1 of Chapter III of Statute XCVI shall be  deleted  and  replaced  by  the  words  'at  least  two  years  pensionable service'.
10. With  effect  from  the  1st  day  of  June  2002  the  words  'who  has completed  at  least  five  years  pensionable  service'  shall  be  inserted immediately after the words 'Should a former staff member' in the last sentence of Section 1 of Chapter III of Statute XCVI.

## APPENDIX I

## Modifying  provisions  in  respect  of  persons  appointed  to  a  post  by  the University on or after the sixth day of April 1995.

Statute  XCVI  of  University  College  Dublin,  together  with  all  subsequent statutes  affecting  the  provision  of  superannuation  benefits,  shall  be  read  and construed with the modifications now set forth.

1. Insofar as a person appointed to any pensionable position in the University was so appointed on or after the sixth day of April 1995, any pension payable  to  such  person  shall  fall  to  be  calculated  by  reference  to  the pensionable  emoluments  of  that  person  as  fixed  in  accordance  with Section  9  of  Statute  XCVI,  less  a  deduction  not  exceeding  twice  the annual equivalent of the maximum weekly pension  (hereinafter called "the  Social  Welfare  Pension")  payable  to  a  fully  qualified  contributor under the Pay Related Social Insurance provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.
2. Subject to Paragraph 4 hereof, benefits preserved in respect of employees who leave the service of the University prior to attaining age 65 shall be computed  as  at  Paragraph  1  hereof,  save  that  the  Social  Welfare Pension  shall  be  fixed  at  the  amount  payable  to  a  fully  qualified contributor  on  the  date  on  which  the  person  left  the  service  of  the University.
3. No increase which is payable in respect of the Social Welfare Pension after the date on which the pension payable under this Scheme commences to be paid shall be taken into account in such a manner as would reduce the amount of the pension payable under this Scheme or of any increase in such pension.
4. Any gratuity falling to be paid subject to Section 12 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI on the retirement of any member of staff shall be calculated on the basis of the salary of the member of staff concerned, calculated in

accordance with Section 9 of the said Chapter without any deduction to take account of the Social Welfare Pension.

5. Any gratuity falling to be paid subject to Section 16 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI on the death of a member of staff shall be calculated on the basis of  the  salary  of  the  member  concerned, calculated in accordance with Section 9 of the said Chapter without any deduction to take account of the Social Welfare Pension.
6. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI members  of  staff  who  are  affected  by  the  conditions  set  out  in  this Appendix shall pay contributions towards the cost of their pensions at the following rate:
3. (a) 3.5% of their pensionable emoluments as calculated in accordance with Paragraph 1 hereof, and
4. (b) 1.5% of their pensionable emoluments as calculated in accordance with Section 9 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI.
7. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI the  University  shall  pay  contributions  in  respect  of  any  members  of staff who are affected by the conditions set out in this Appendix equal to  twice  the  contributions  being  paid  by  each  such  member  under paragraph 6 hereof.
8. Notwithstanding the provision of Section 1 of Chapter III of Statute XCVI where a member of staff who is affected by the conditions set out in this Appendix
7. (a) leaves the service of the University prior to the 1st day of June 2002 having completed less than 5 years pensionable service; or
8. (b) leaves  the  service  of  the  University  on  or  after  the  1st  day  of June  2002  having  completed  less  than  2  years  pensionable service

his/her contributions paid under paragraph 6 hereof shall be refunded to him/her less an amount equal to any income tax liability deducted by the University in respect of such contributions.

9. Where a person who is in receipt of a pension under this Scheme, and due to causes outside his own control:
2. (a) fails to qualify for Social Welfare Pension; or
3. (b) qualifies for Social Welfare Pension at a reduced rate,

then  for  so  long  as  the  preconditions  set  out  in  this  Paragraph  are complied  with,  the  person  concerned  may,  at  the  discretion  of  the University, by special resolution of the Governing Authority, be paid a supplementary pension under this Scheme.

In  the  case  of  a  person  referred  to  at  (a)  above,  the  supplementary pension payable comprises the difference between

- (i) the amount of the actual pension awarded to that person and
- (ii) the amount of the pension which would have been awarded to him/her if that pension had been calculated by reference to the pensionable  emoluments  of  that  person  as  fixed  in  accordance with  Section  9  of  Statute  XCVI  rather  than  the  pensionable emoluments of that person as fixed in accordance with Section 9 of Statute XCVI less a deduction not exceeding twice the annual equivalent  of  the  maximum  weekly  pension  payable  to  a  fully qualified  contributor  under  the  Pay  Related  Social  Insurance provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.

In  the  case  of  a  person  referred  to  at  (b)  above,  the  supplementary pension payable comprises the difference between

- (i) the  amount of the actual pension awarded to that person plus the amount of the personal rate of Social Insurance benefit or pension payable to him/her and
- (ii) the  amount  of  the  pension  which  would  have  been  awarded  to him/her  if  that  pension  had  been  calculated  by  reference  to  the pensionable emoluments of that person as fixed in accordance with Section 9 of Statute XCVI rather than the pensionable emoluments of  that  person  as  fixed  in  accordance  with  Section  9  of  Statute XCVI less a deduction not exceeding twice the annual equivalent of  the  maximum  weekly  pension  payable  to  a  fully  qualified contributor  under  the  Pay  Related  Social  Insurance  provisions  of the Social Welfare Acts.

## APPENDIX II

Statute  XCVI  of  University  College  Dublin,  together  with  all  subsequent statutes  affecting  the  provision  of  superannuation  benefits,  shall  be  read  and construed with the modifications now set forth.

1. Insofar as a person appointed to any pensionable position in the University was  so  appointed  on  or  after  the  sixth  day  of  April  1995,  any  pension payable  under  the  provisions  of  the  Scheme  set  out  in  Chapter  II  to  the widow, widower or children of such person shall fall to be calculated by reference  to  the  pensionable  emoluments  of  that  person  as  fixed  in accordance with Section 9 of Statute XCVI, less a deduction not exceeding the annual equivalent of the maximum weekly pension  (hereinafter called "the  Social  Welfare  Pension")  payable  to  a  fully  qualified  contributor under the Pay Related Social Insurance provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.
2. No increase  which  is  payable  in  respect  of  the  Social  Welfare  Widow's, Widower's or Children's or Orphans' Pensions after the date on which the pension payable under this Scheme commences to be paid shall be taken into account in such a manner as would reduce the amount of the pension payable under this Scheme or the amount of any increase in such pension.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10 of Chapter II of Statute XCVI members  of  staff  who  are  affected  by  the  conditions  set  out  in  this Appendix shall pay contributions towards the cost of their pensions at a rate of 1.5% of their pensionable emoluments as calculated in accordance with Section 9 of Chapter I of Statute XCVI.
