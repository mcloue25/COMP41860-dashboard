Due to commitments associated with high performance sport, UCD high performance athletes at times, may require academic flexibility  and  in  exceptional  circumstances  may  need  to  avail  of  a  leave  of absence or extend their degree programme.

To ensure consistency and equity for all UCD high performance athletes, a university policy is required.

Examples  of  such  circumstances  may  include  (i)  the university not including a club for that particular sport or (ii) the university club not competing at an elite level 1 .
- Participation in intervarsity competition is not normally considered high performance.

## 4. Scope - defining academic flexibility

UCD recognises the important contribution that High Performance Athletes make to the reputation of the University through their participation in national and/or international-level competitions.

Due to their participation in training and competition, High Performance Athletes may require authorised absence from lectures, tutorials,  and laboratories. In  addition,  they  may  require  academic  flexibility related  to  the  timing  of  assessments,  participation  in  group-based  work,  and  commitments  to  work placements/internships. Specific examples of academic flexibility are listed below:

- Authorised absences from lectures, laboratories, workshops, seminars, tutorials, study visits, clinical fieldwork, work experience, internships etc. Such authorisations should be considered where students are engaged and progressing in their programmes.
- Flexible deadlines for the submission of coursework. Such authorisations should be considered where students are engaged and progressing in their programmes.
- Flexible arrangements for work placements and internships, where possible.
- The opportunity to sit examinations at alternative agreed times and locations, invigilated by designated,  responsible  individuals  (e.g.,  UCD  Club  Coach,  UCD  Staff  Member,  National Governing Body Personnel) as approved by the UCD Director of Assessment. This requires advanced planning by the High Performance Athlete and module coordinator and should be authorised by the UCD Director of Assessment.
- Encouragement to consider whether an alternative  individual  work  piece  rather  than  group work, is appropriate subject to meeting the learning outcomes of the module.

Requests for academic flexibility require advance notification and detailed planning. However, due to the nature of high performance sports, it may not always be possible to seek planned support in advance (for example late call ups to squads). In such cases, it is the responsibility of the High Performance Athlete to make contact with the module coordinator as soon as possible to discuss the possibility of flexible academic arrangements.

High Performance Athletes in exceptional circumstances may request the following in consultation with their Academic Mentor (where appointed), Governing Board and Scholarships Programme:

- The  opportunity/possibility  to  avail  of  a  leave  of  absence  when  required  due  to  sporting commitments.
- The opportunity/possibility to extend their degree programme to a maximum of one additional academic year due to sporting commitments.

● 1 Under exceptional circumstances a committee (see Appendix 1) will be established to review an athlete's status to determine if they should be classified as a High Performance Athlete.

In  such  cases  the  Governing  Board  will  determine  when  such  academic  flexibility  is  appropriate  or feasible in terms of each student's academic performance and/or when a move to an extended duration of their degree programme or a leave of absence may be advisable.

## 5. Principles

UCD as part of its mission is committed to recruiting, supporting and developing high performance athletes.

The University, where possible, will support requests from high performance athletes' to have academic flexibility due to their sporting commitments.

The  policy  will  be  transparent  and  outline  clear  guidelines  for  the  High  Performance  Athletes  and relevant staff in their academic programmes.

Requests should be made before the commencement of training/competition and where possible, at the start of the trimester. In ad hoc cases, the application should be dealt with as quickly and as locally as possible, for example by the module coordinator and/or Head of School. Retrospective applications may be considered only in exceptional cases, whereby there are valid reasons for non-submission within the usual timeframe. Such applications will be managed at the appropriate level, for example, by the module coordinator, Head of School, and/or Governing Board as appropriate.

The University reserves the right to investigate the validity of applications. Where necessary, cases will be referred to the UCD Student Code of Conduct.

## 6. Process

High Performing Athletes are required to complete a formal schedule at the start of each academic year outlining  their  sporting  commitments,  which  must  be  reviewed/approved  by  their  Scholarships Programme/UCD Sports. This will be provided to the athlete's Programme at the start of each year and updated each trimester, if required.

This  schedule  will  include  their  full  competitive  and  training  commitments,  as  well  as  any  other opportunities they identify where they may be asked to represent their sport. The onus is on the athlete to outline any potential conflicts between their academic and sporting commitments.

Where  clashes  between  the  High  Performance  Athletes  academic  and  sporting  commitments  are identified and academic flexibility is required, the athlete will need to complete and submit the UCD's High Performance Athlete Academic Flexibility Application Form to their module coordinator/Programme Office for approval. Requests should be made before the commencement of the training/competition and where possible, at the start of trimester.

In cases where requests are being made for leave of absence or extending their programme, this must also be approved by the athletes Governing Board.

In  exceptional  circumstances,  retrospective  applications  may  be  considered  where  there  are  valid reasons for non-submission within the usual timeframe.

For circumstances unrelated to sports the UCD Extenuating Circumstances policy should be used.

Academic flexibility requested by a High Performance Athlete is never guaranteed. The final decision on such applications rests with the athlete's Governing Board. If a Governing Board refuses a request, the decision will be communicated to the athlete and their Scholarships Programme/UCD Sports.

The  High  Performance  Athlete  is  required  to  complete  all  aspects  of  their  academic  programme. Athletes will not be exempt from submitting mandatory pieces of assessed work and will be expected to meet the learning outcomes of the programme by an agreed date.

Where a High Performance Athlete has been approved to extend their programme, the Governing Board will notify UCD Fees of the decision.
