## Annual Leave Policy &amp; Procedures

<!-- image -->

## Policy owner UCD HR Approval date and body UMT, 28 February 2023

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to ensure that UCD employees are adequately informed of their annual leave entitlements. This document sets out the annual leave arrangements for employees of the University.

## 2. Definitions

Annual Leave All employees, whether they are full-time, part-time or temporary, are entitled to time away from the workplace for the purposes of rest and relaxation. These period(s) are referred to as annual leave.

## 3. Scope

This annual leave policy applies to all UCD employees who are in receipt of a salary under a permanent contract, a contract of indefinite duration (CID), or a fixed-term contract as defined in the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003 and those who are entitled to benefit under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.

## 4. Principles

University College Dublin is committed to providing an inclusive and diverse environment in which all members of our community are valued and supported, both in the workplace and in their family life. As such, the University is committed to ensuring that UCD employees have access to their annual leave entitlements in a clear and transparent manner.

## 5. Entitlements

The annual leave year runs for 12 months from 1 January until 31 December each year. Employees who work part-time, or for a proportion of the leave year, will have pro rata entitlements to annual leave. Annual leave entitlements are granted in accordance with the terms of the Working Time Act, 1997.

Details on the amount of annual leave that employees are entitled to can be found in section 6 of this policy.

The Annual leave entitlements that are set out in this policy are subject to change from time to time.

## 6. Annual Leave Procedure

All applications for annual leave must be approved by the relevant Head of School/Unit or nominee. Employees are required to ensure that their Head of School/Unit or nominee is provided with advance notification of their intention to take annual leave so that appropriate cover arrangements may be made where necessary, and also that appropriate records may be maintained in compliance with UCD policies and external legal requirements.

Each Head of School/Unit will establish procedures for recording annual leave and agreeing the period of notice required in advance of the leave being taken. Leave will be granted having regard to the individual needs of the employee but also ensuring that the needs of the service provided are met at all times. Every reasonable effort should be made to facilitate annual leave requests.

## Carry-Over of Leave

Ideally, annual leave should be taken within the leave year. In exceptional circumstances, some leave may be carried over to the following leave year, with the approval of the Head of School/Unit, provided there is mutual agreement that such leave will be taken in the following leave year.

## Other Leave

In relation to leave required for work commitments off campus such as attendance at seminars or conferences, advance notification and approval by the relevant Head of School/Unit or nominee is also required so that appropriate cover arrangements may be made where necessary.

## Public Holidays (and Good Friday)

In addition to annual leave, employees have an entitlement to Public Holidays. There are 10 public holidays in Ireland each year (increased from 9 in 2022). These are:

- New Year's Day
- St Patrick's Day
- St Brigid's Day (see note below)
- Easter Monday
- First Monday in May, June, August
- Last Monday in October;
- Christmas Day and St Stephen's Day
- Good Friday (additional to these dates although it is not a Public Holiday)

Note: From 2023 , there will be a new annual public holiday in early February to mark St Brigid's Day. The public holiday will be the first Monday in February, except where St Brigid's day (1 February) happens to fall on a Friday, in which case that Friday 1 February will be a public holiday.

Employees who work on a Public Holiday or Good Friday will be permitted to time in lieu at an alternative agreed time, subject to collective agreements and preapproved local arrangements.

## Part Time Employees

Part time employees must have worked at least 40 hours in the five weeks ending on the day before the public holiday to qualify for public holiday benefit.

You can count time spent on annual leave as 'time worked' when calculating the 40 hours worked in the 5 weeks before the public holiday.

Qualifying employees are entitled to one of the below public holiday benefit

1. where a public holiday falls on a day on which the employee normally works, the employee is entitled to a paid day off.
2. where the public holiday falls on a day on which the employee does not normally work, the employee is entitled to time in lieu equivalent to one fifth of their normal weekly hours.
3. where the employee is required to work on the public holiday, the employee is entitled to a day in lieu or an additional day of annual leave.

Time in lieu must be taken on agreement with Line/Manager.

## Christmas Closure

UCD closes for 4 working days during the Christmas period. Employees are required to take these 4 days from their total annual leave entitlement. Closure days may be changed from year to year to reflect the University's requirements. The exact dates are listed on the UCD HR website, and they will usually cover the period between Christmas and the New Year.
