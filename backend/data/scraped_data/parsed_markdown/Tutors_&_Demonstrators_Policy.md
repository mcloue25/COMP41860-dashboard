## Tutors &amp; Demonstrators Policy

## 1. Policy Summary

This policy describes the circumstances under which hourly paid tutors and demonstrators may engage in paid work throughout the University.  It outlines the eligibility criteria and the approval which is required.

## 2. Scope of the Policy

This policy applies to anyone engaged in tutoring/demonstrating in the University.

## 3. Eligibility

Tutors/Demonstrators should, except in exceptional circumstances, be registered students.  UCD permits registered students to work up to a maximum number of 9 hours per week as agreed with the Head of School/Unit.

Non-EEA registered students require a valid GNIB card before a contract can be processed.  These students are restricted by law to working a maximum a 20 hours per week without a valid Work Permit.

## 4. Policy

The appointment of Tutors/Demonstrators is made on an annual basis and may be renewable annually for a period of up to 4 years.  The Head of School must ensure that a tutor/demonstrator contract is completed and signed by the appropriate parties, and submitted to UCD HR.

An Exception Approval must be completed and authorised by the Head of School/Unit in the following circumstances:

- -Where the tutor/demonstrator is not a registered student
- -If it is intended that the tutor/demonstrator works more than the maximum 9 hours allowed by this contract

An Additional Duties Approval must be completed and authorised by the Head of School/Unit in the following circumstances:

If a tutor/demonstrator is already working in another capacity in his/her own school or another school on a full-time basis, the approval of his/her primary Head of School is required to ensure that the appointment as tutor/demonstrator does not interfere with his/her normal duties.

Non-EEA registered students should provide a photocopy of their GNIB card prior to commencing employment.  It is an offence to employ a non-EEA national without the correct immigration documentation.

Payment is made on an hourly basis as per the approved rates of pay for tutors/demonstrators.  Holiday entitlement is calculated on the basis of 8% of hours worked.

Tutors/Demonstrators may not offer, or be involved in, the presentation of commercial grinds within the University.

## 5. Guidelines

The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 limits the maximum average working week to 48 hours.  The maximum cumulative time per week that a Tutor/Demonstrator may work in any combination of employment is 48 hours. Weekly working time can be averaged over a 4-month reference period.

Payment will not be made for claimed hours unless a signed Contract has been received by UCD Human Resources.  If a tutor/demonstrator works for more than one School, a contract is required from each School.

Tutors/Demonstrators are liable for Pay Related Social Insurance, and must provide a PPS number.  Payment may be withheld if a PPS number has not been supplied with the contract.

All claims must be made within one month of the date on which the work was completed.

It is the responsibility of the Head of School to ensure that all documentation is completed accurately before authorising.  All incomplete documentation will be returned to the appropriate School.
