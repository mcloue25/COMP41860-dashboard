## 4.  Principles

The  University  is  committed  to  achieving  the  highest  standards  of  excellence  in  the  research  training, professional development and supervision of graduate research students and expects all relevant parties to adhere to the following core principles.

## 4.1 Proactive engagement in forming and cultivating a positive, professional relationship founded on mutual respect.

- Principal Supervisors and graduate research students are expected to clarify their expectations of the relationship at the start of, and at appropriate stages, throughout the research programme. Specifically agreeing, how they will maintain clear and regular communication, how they will schedule and prepare for meetings, how and when feedback will be provided and how the research degree student will meet their milestones.
- Principal Supervisors and Schools must work together to provide continuity of supervision throughout the research programme. In instances where a change of supervision is needed, the Head of School will make every effort to secure alternative arrangements for the supervision of the student with minimal delay.
- Principal Supervisors and graduate research students will engage with University processes and procedures for resolving conflict. Conflict resolution is a way for two or more parties to find a satisfactory solution to conflict, ideally coming to a settlement that benefits all parties.

## 4.2 Developing graduate research students as independent researchers.

- There is a mutual responsibility for Principal Supervisors, Co-supervisors (where relevant) and graduate research students to work together to develop feasible research projects.
- Principal Supervisors, Co-supervisors (where relevant) and students must work together to maintain consistent progress in the research, engage in the Stage Transfer Assessment and other review processes and complete the research programme in a manner defined in the Academic Regulations.
- Principal Supervisors &amp; Co-supervisors (where relevant) must support candidates in the preparation of an examinable thesis

## 4.3 Promoting a strong research training culture and environment based on an intellectual and collegiate research community.

- Principal Supervisors &amp; Co-supervisors (where relevant) and graduate research students are expected to engage in developing and promoting a culture supportive of networking, mentoring and development, including expanding research and generic skills to support the candidate's personal and professional development.
- Principal Supervisors &amp; Co-supervisors (where relevant) and graduate research students should be mindful about managing conflicts and competing interests in such areas as authorship and intellectual property.
- Grievances between student and a Principal Supervisor or Co-supervisors (where relevant) must be sensitively and proactively managed by Schools.
- Principal Supervisors &amp; Co-supervisors (where relevant) and students are expected to engage in publication and/or dissemination of research findings appropriate to disciplinary norms.

## 4.4 Practice research according to the fundamental principles of research integrity, excellence and safety.

- Supervisors and students will promote and uphold the principles of academic integrity in the conduct of their learning and research activities.
- Supervisors and students must conduct their research with integrity and in accordance with the regulations, policies and guidelines of the university and applicable legislation.
- Principal Supervisors, in consultation with the Head of School, are expected to identify and agree that appropriate resources are available to support the proposed research activity.
- Supervisors must have an active and continuing participation in research.
- Every graduate research student must satisfactorily complete Research Integrity Training. PhD students admitted after 31st August 2024 must complete this training in Stage 1 of the PhD programme.

## 5  Roles and Responsibilities

## 5.1 Role &amp; Responsibilities of the Principal Supervisor

The  Principal  Supervisor  has  primary  responsibility  for  the  academic  supervision  of  the  research  degree student. i.e. the Principal Supervisor takes overall responsibility for the student's research training and must strive to provide an excellent educational experience for research students which defines international best practice. The Principal Supervisor also has primary responsibility for the conduct of the student-supervisor relationship,  management  of  the  student's  research  progress  and  in  guiding  th e  student  to  conduct  their research with integrity and in accordance with the regulations, policies and guidelines of the university and applicable legislation. The Principal Supervisor has responsibility for nominating a Postdoctoral Researcher who  is  one  year  Post  PhD  and  research  active  to  be  an  Assistant  Supervisor  where  appropriate.  These responsibilities cannot be delegated.

## 5.2 Role &amp; Responsibilities of The Co-Supervisor

Where appointed, the Co-Supervisor supports the Principal Supervisor in the academic supervision of the student. The Co-Supervisor may assume (where appropriate) the responsibilities of the Principal Supervisor in the event that the student's programme of study exceeds the duration of the initial Principal Supervisor's contract, and the status of the CoSupervisor's contract facilitates this.

## 5.3 Role &amp; Responsibilities of Adjunct Supervisor

Where appointed, an adjunct or visiting faculty member entered on the Register of Approved Adjunct and Visiting Supervisors supports the Principal Supervisor in the academic supervision of the student. An Adjunct Supervisor can be appointed as a Principal Supervisor or Co-supervisor and would assume responsibilities of that role if so appointed.

## 5.4 Role &amp; Responsibilities of External Supervisor

If a research student is based for longer than one trimester off campus in an external organisation including research institutes, industry laboratory or studio, government agency or non-government organisation and an approved Adjunct Supervisor is not in place, a member of staff of the external organisation must be appointed as an External Supervisor. An External Supervisor must be specifically approved by the Graduate Research Board on the recommendation of a School and their name entered on the Register  of Approved External Supervisors. The External Supervisor must be a member of the Research Studies Panel.

## 5.5 Role &amp; Responsibilities of Assistant Supervisor

An Assistant Supervisor will be nominated by the Principal Supervisor, with the endorsement of the Head of School, and approved by the Graduate Research Board, and if approved, their name entered on the Register of Approved Assistant Supervisors. The responsibilities of the Assistant Supervisor will include provision of advice to the graduate research student for day-to-day research/ trouble-shooting issues that do not require intervention by the Principal/Co-Supervisors and providing research skills training and project management guidance to the student. The Assistant Supervisor is also expected to provide informal mentoring to the student, including research and professional career development as appropriate. It is expected that the Assistant Supervisor will be a member of the student's Research Studies Panel (RSP ), and they will attend supervisory meetings as agreed with the Principal Supervisor. The Assistant Supervisor is not expected to be involved in the recruitment and selection of graduate research students, monitoring of their progress or supporting thesis completion or final examination. The Assistant Supervisor is expected to undertake training in supervision available within the University.

## 5.6 Role &amp; Responsibilities of the Graduate Research Student

The graduate research student has responsibility for their own research activity and learning. It is expected that graduate research students will actively engage with their Principal Supervisor on an ongoing basis and make reasonable efforts to achieve goals and milestones agreed with their Principal Supervisor and Research Studies  Panel.  The  graduate  research  student  is  expected  to  ensure  that  all  or  any  ethical  requirements associated with their research are addressed at the appropriate time and are required to comply with best and ethical practice and the regulations, policies and guidelines of the University and applicable legislation in the conduct of their research. The student must document their educational, training and personal and professional development needs as part of their Research and Professional Development Planning (RPDP). Graduate research students must comply with UCD Academic Regulations.

## 5.7 Role &amp; Responsibilities of the Research Studies Panel

The role of the Research Studies Panel (RSP) is to enhance the supervisor(s)-student relationship by the provision of advice in accordance with the University's policies, practices, guidelines and procedures. The RSP will monitor progress against the prescribed programme of research and study and will meet at least twice in the first year and at least once a year thereafter. Each meeting will be documented and have an agreed action plan written by the Chair and signed off by the Chair on behalf of RSP members. RSP Terms of Reference are detailed in Appendix 1.

## 5.8 Role &amp; Responsibilities of the School

The School will establish appropriate processes and procedures to monitor the progress of individual research students registered in the School. Schools will monitor the number of students that Principal Supervisors and members of the Research Studies Panels are responsible for, to prevent the overburdening of the relevant parties.

## 5.9 Role &amp; Responsibilities of the Head of School

- Support a nomination and make a recommendation for admission of the candidate to the Governing Board.
- Ensure that robust procedures in accordance with University policies and procedures are in place to address any alleged breaches of academic integrity.
- Highlight appropriate supports, training and/or professional development programmes for research supervisors in their school.
- Support a nomination of an Assistant Supervisor and make a recommendation for their appointment to the Graduate Research Board.
- Make every effort to secure alternative arrangements for the supervision of a student with minimal delay should the Principal Supervisor be unable to supervise the student or where a degree of conflict has arisen that a recommendation of appointment of a new Principal Supervisor be made to the Graduate Research Board. Where alternative arrangements cannot be secured, the Head of School will submit a report with their recommended course of action to the Graduate Research Board

## 5.10 Role &amp; Responsibilities of the Graduate Research Board

- Be responsible for the development, approval, and review of the graduate research programmes of the University.
- Develop policies, procedures, guidelines, and initiatives as appropriate to promote effectiveness, excellence, and fairness in the delivery and governance of graduate research programmes.

## APPENDIX 1

## RESEARCH STUDIES PANEL Terms of Reference

## 1.  Purpose

Research Studies Panels are designed to enhance the supervisor-student relationship and to ensure the quality of the research student experience in the context of structured research degrees.

## 2.  Composition of Research Studies Panel

- Principal supervisor
- Any co-supervisor(s) or external supervisor
- A number of advisers (at least two but normally no more than four)

Full regulations for the appointment of a Research Studies Panel are available in sections 7, 8 or 9 of the academic regulations (with some variations in composition for programmes referenced in sections 8 or 9 of regulations).

The Research Studies Panel must appoint a Chair independent of Principal/Co-Supervisors.

Members of the Research Studies Panel will not normally act on the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel of the student, unless prior approval obtained from the relevant Governing Board is obtained, and cannot act as an Internal examiner for that student.

## 3.  Conduct of Business

The Research Studies Panel should meet at least once soon after the student begins their graduate research programme of study. The Research Studies Panel should meet to review progress on a regular basis, but at least twice in the first year and at least once a year thereafter.

The student or  another member of the RSP may convene a meeting of the panel at any stage (with appropriate notice to all concerned) if it is considered desirable or necessary to address any relevant issue that may arise.

After the introductory meeting, a student would typically organise future meetings. If it is noted that  a meeting(s) is/are overdue for a student then the supervisor or School should engage with the student on this matter.

A Research Studies Panel will conduct its business in accordance with relevant UCD policies and regulations, including the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy.

## 4. Terms of Reference

The responsibilities of a Research Studies Panel include monitoring the progress of the student through their graduate research studies, ensuring the quality of supervision, and providing advice, guidance and support to the student and supervisor. The key responsibilities of the Research Studies Panel are to:

- 4.1. Enhance the supervisor-student relationship by the provision of advice in accordance with the University's Policy for Supervision of Research Degree Students .
- 4.2. Ensure quality, rigour and equity of the supervision process.

- 4.3. Advise the student on their professional and personal development training and monitor progress against their Research and Professional Development Plan (RPDP.)

- 4.5. Provide appropriate academic expertise and where appropriate facilitate an interdisciplinary perspective.
- 4.6. In the event that a principal supervisor is unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances, Academic Regulations state that the Head of School should ensure that arrangements for the supervision of a student are in place. The RSP should provide temporary support to the student, if a co-supervisor is not already identified, where a Head of School is required to identify a new supervisor.
- 4.7. Seek to resolve any difficulties that may arise in the supervisor-student relationship. Where matters are unresolved, they will initially be addressed at the local or School level and ultimately be referred to the Chair of the relevant Governing Board if escalated.
- 4.8. Offer additional specific support for students or supervisors which the Governing Board may request.

## 5. Governance

- 5.1. The Research Studies Panel is, in all activities and decisions, subject to review by the Governing Board and the Academic Council or its relevant committee
- 5.2. A Research Studies Panel may support one or more students at a time.
