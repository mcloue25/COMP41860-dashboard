Version 1.16

## 1.  INTRODUCTION &amp; CONTEXT

The Policy on Progression in Doctoral Programmes defines specific guidelines for the formal progression of students on doctoral programmes. Each School can have locally defined requirements but the School and/or Doctoral Programme Co-ordinator must document their specific guidelines and criteria and inform students and supervisors  of  these  requirements.  The  policy  recognises  good  practice  in  monitoring  doctoral  student progression where it currently exists and establishes common norms and procedures designed to support the doctoral programmes and all those involved with them.

The aim of the Policy on Progression in Doctoral Programmes is to provide a framework supplemental to the Academic Regulations which articulates the practices and procedures associated with the transfer of students from Stage 1 to Stage 2 of the doctoral programme and the progression of students within Stage 2. It defines the  mode of assessment, identifies the role and responsibilities of the Assessment Panel in managing and facilitating the process of formal progression, describes the implementation of Assessment Panel decisions, and outlines the mechanism available to students to appeal the decision of the Assessment Panel.

Further support for students and supervisors involved with doctoral programmes is provided by a range of instruments, including the UCD Academic Regulations , and the Policy for Supervision of Graduate Research Students 1 .

## 2. SCOPE &amp; STRUCTURE OF POLICY

The Policy on Progression in Doctoral Programmes is structured across the following categories:

- Roles and Responsibilities of the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel - details on the constitution of the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel, the relationship between the Research Studies Panel and the Assessment Panel, the process for adjudication on formal progression, and the relationship of the Assessment Panel and its  decision-making  processes  to  Schools  Doctoral  Programme  Co-ordinators  and  Governing  Board (Graduate Research Board).
- Mode of Assessment - guidelines on the type of assessment undertaken by students at the point of transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 and progression within Stage 2 and the timeframe within which such assessment takes place.
- Implementation  of  Stage  Transfer  Assessment  Panel  Decisions -  procedures  for  managing  student transfer and progression and methods for reporting on successful/unsuccessful transfer and progression to the School, Governing Board and relevant University academic and administrative units.
- Process for Student Appeal of the Assessment Panel Decision - information on the process through which a student may appeal a decision of the Assessment Panel, the timeframe within which this process should  take  place,  details  regarding  the  composition  of  the  Appeal  Committee  and  guidelines  for  that committee, and information regarding the possible outcomes of the appeal process.

## 3.  ROLES &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE ASSESSMENT PANEL

The  Assessment Panel is responsible for formally assessing the progress of a student through their doctoral programme. Membership of the Assessment Panel is defined by the Head of School and/or Doctoral Programme Co-ordinator . Each  Head  of  School  and/or  Doctoral  Programme  Co-ordinator  may  establish  either  a  single Assessment Panel for all students at the end of Stage 1 of a specific doctoral programme, or multiple Assessment Panels as and where appropriate. The Assessment Panel must have the experience and disciplinary expertise to conduct the assessment, and will normally consist of three members of faculty of the University  at least one of whom will be a permanent member of faculty. The Assessment Panel may include a member of the adjunct or visiting staff of the University whose name has been entered on the Register of Approved Adjunct, Visiting and Affiliated  Supervisors 2 . Where a doctoral programme spans multiple institutions, the Assessment Panel may incorporate academic staff from participating higher education institutions. Membership of the student's Stage Transfer Assessment Panel and their Research Studies Panel should not normally overlap. Any overlap of the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel and the Research Studies Panel requires the prior approval of the Graduate Research Board.

The Principal Supervisor, and any Co-Supervisor, shall not be a member of the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel. However, the Principal Supervisor shall play a major role in the transfer assessment process through the submission of a written report on the student's progress within Stage 1 or any formal assessment within Stage 2 recommended by the School.

https://www.ucd.ie/graduatestudies/documentrepository

It is the responsibility of the Chair of the Assessment Panel to notify the Principal Supervisor of the timeframe within which the transfer assessment must take place. The Principal Supervisor, in consultation with the student and the Assessment Panel, will define a date on which the student must submit material for consideration of the transfer  assessment.  The  student  and  Principal  Supervisor  will  be  notified  of  the  outcome  of  the  transfer assessment and the recommendation made to the Graduate Research Board within one month of the date of submission of material.

Following the Stage Transfer Assessment, the Chair of the Assessment Panel is responsible for completing the Doctoral Programme Progression Assessment Report &amp; Recommendation Form, which will be made available to the student, Principal Supervisor( and Co-supervisor, if relevant)Head of School and/or Doctoral Programme Co-ordinator.

## 4 MODE OF ASSESSMENT

To accommodate the academic diversity across the University, and the different types of research undertaken within doctoral programmes, the mode of assessment for the transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 must be flexible enough to capture and accommodate this range of diversity. At the same time, it is also essential that a standard of quality be maintained to ensure that the student is making satisfactory progress in pursuit of the aims and objectives of their research as agreed with the Principal Supervisor,  any Co-supervisor(s) and the Research Studies Panel and documented in the Research and Professional Development Plan (RPDP).

The Stage Transfer Assessment will take place within five trimesters from the date of registration for full-time doctoral students, and within seven trimesters from the date of registration for part-time doctoral students.

The  following  documents  are  required  for  submission  to  the  Assessment  Panel  at  the  point  of  the  transfer assessment, and will form the basis of the decision of the Assessment Panel:

- Supporting documentation , as determined and documented by the School and/or Doctoral Programme Co-ordinator, such as examples of written work, draft chapter of the thesis, portfolio, evidence of successful completion of taught modules as required or recommended by the Principal Supervisor and/or Research Studies Panel
- Research and Professional Development Plan (RPDP):  Part 1 and Part 2 of the RPDP Form, from the most recent Research Studies Panel (RSP) meeting, must be completed and signed off by the student and Chair of the RSP. The student should submit a copy to their School as part of the Transfer Assessment submission.
- Progress Report by the Principal Supervisor : a short report on the progress of the student within Stage 1 or any formal assessment within Stage 2 recommended by the relevant Governing Board.
- For students admitted after 31 st  August 2024, a formal record of completion of research integrity training

An oral presentation by the student, and an interview with the student, must also form part of the process. The Assessment Panel may interview the Principal Supervisor (and Co-supervisor if relevant).

All relevant documentation should be kept on record by the School Office for 13 months after the date of a student's completion of the doctoral programme.

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSESSMENT PANEL DECISIONS

The student and Principal Supervisor will be notified of the outcome of the assessment and the recommendation made to the Graduate Research Board normally within one month of the date of the formal assessment. To this end, upon completion of the progression assessment, and normally within one month of the date of the formal assessment, the completed Doctoral Programme Progression Assessment Report &amp; Recommendation Form 3 shall be circulated to the student, Principal Supervisor, Head of School and where relevant, Doctoral Programme Co-ordinator

As stipulated in the Academic Regulations , the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel will make one of the following recommendations to the Graduate School Board.

- A. that the student should progress to Stage 2 of the doctoral programme;
- B. that the student should not progress to Stage 2 of the doctoral programme, and that:
- I. The  student  should  re-submit  for  assessment  within  six  months  (with  an  indication  of  the month/year in which the subsequent formal assessment of progress will take place). This option is  only  available  on  a  maximum  of  two  occasions  after  which,  option  (ii)  or  (iii)  must  be recommended.
- II. The student should apply to transfer to another graduate programme utilising, where appropriate, any credits already accumulated in Stage 1 of the doctoral programme;
- III. In line with the University's continuation policy and procedures, a recommendation be made to the Governing Board that the student's registration is discontinued

The  Doctoral  Programme  Progression  Assessment  Report  and  Recommendation  Form  shall  be signed by the Chair of the Assessment Panel, the Head of School and the Doctoral Programme Coordinator, and the Chair of the Assessment Panel shall forward the recommendation to the relevant Programme Office.

The Graduate Research  Board will formally approve the recommendation of the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel and the student's record will be updated accordingly. When the recommendation has been formally approved, the relevant School Office will inform the student, the Principal Supervisor, the Chair of the Assessment Panel and the other Stage Transfer Assessment Panel members. It is the responsibility of the relevant School Office to maintain a record of the relevant documentation for 13 months after the date of a student's completion of the doctoral programme.

## 6. OTHER FORMAL ASSESSMENTS OF PROGRESS

On the recommendation of the Head of School and/or Doctoral Programme Co-ordinator, , additional formal assessments to determine progression within Stage 2 of the doctoral programme may be undertaken, or such assessments may be a normal element of a doctoral programme. In such instances, students must be notified of the requirement for an additional formal assessment no less than one month before the date of submission for that assessment. The procedures for undertaking any additional formal assessments of progress should be the same as those used for the formal transfer assessment from Stage 1 to Stage 2.

## 7. PROCESS FOR STUDENT APPEAL OF ANY FORMAL ASSESSMENT PANEL DECISION

A student who wishes to appeal a decision of the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel may do so through the procedures  for  a  formal  assessment  appeal  determined  in  the  UCD  Policy  on  Assessment  Appeals. Information relating to Assessment Appeals can be found at: http://www.ucd.ie/appeals/
