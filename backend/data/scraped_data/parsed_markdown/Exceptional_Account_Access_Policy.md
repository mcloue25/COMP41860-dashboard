## 1. Purpose

University  College  Dublin  provides  information  technology  services  to  its  users  so  that  they  can perform work for the University in support of UCD's mission. The purpose of the Exceptional Account Access Policy is to, in limited special circumstances, grant temporary access to a member of UCD, other than the named Account Holder, for the purpose of UCD business matters, including business continuity, or in situations where the University agrees to said access for compassionate reasons. In its Acceptable Use Policy UCD states 'Please be aware that UCD retains ownership of all IT accounts, data, and services for all IT accounts issued by UCD.' In line with this acceptable use, University accounts and the data therein, should be expected to contain University and not private content and data.

This  policy  sets  out  how  the  University  responds  to  exceptional  requests  outside  of  standard business  practices,  to  authorise  a  UCD  person  or  UCD  party's  access  to  'Data'  held  in  any University  supported  IT  service  or  University  owned  device,  whether  it  is  provided  directly  by  a University unit or is managed by a third party on behalf of the University.

## 2. Definitions

The named ' Account Holder ' is an authorised user with data that is stored on a University supported IT service or University owned device.

- The ' Approver ' is the Data Protection Officer or nominee.
- The ' Requestor ' is a Head of Unit (HoU) or School (HoS) or other authorised UCD requestor.
- The ' Exceptional Account Access Policy form ' is the form that the Requestor must submit in order to be granted approval to access the named Account Holder's data.
-   The ' Service Owner '  is  the  unit  that  is  accountable for the IT service regardless of where the technology components reside. 'IT Services' is the Service Owner of many, but not all, of UCD's IT systems. The service owner for devices is the school or unit that has purchased the device.
- ' Data ' is information created, collected, maintained, and utilised by University account users while using these services or University owned devices, whether they are provided directly by a University unit or are managed by a third party on behalf of the University. The concept of Data includes personal data, communications and logs.

The University is committed to maintaining named users' privacy, and as a data controller the University is  required  to  comply  with  its  obligations  under  national  and  European  data  protection  legislation, including the GDPR.

## 3. Scope

as Requestor

IN SCOPE: The Exceptional Account Access Policy is strictly limited to exceptional requests to the University,  outside  of  standard  business  practices,  to  authorise  a  UCD  person  or  UCD  party  to access data held in any University supported IT service or University owned device, whether it is provided directly by a University unit or is managed by a third party on behalf of the University.

UCD person/

party

Examples of such requests include, but are not limited to the following:

reaches named

Account Holder

Service Owner informs named account

Named Account

Holder needs to

- To provide business related data in the event that an Account Holder is incapacitated, leaves unexpectedly or is on extended leave and cannot be contacted. This may include access to an Account Holder's email, storage, University owned device, etc.
- To provide access to a member of the university to retrieve specific data related to the deceased individual, on behalf of their next of kin or executor, in the case of bereavement or incapacitation. DPO returns

- Where the University needs to access data in an account or on a UCD owned device to detect or prevent criminal activities, or to defend itself against legal claims or accusations in court. No

OUT OF SCOPE: The Exceptional Account Access Policy does not cover instances where:

- The  University  is  compelled  by  law,  or  Court  Order,  to  produce  data  contained  in  a  UCD account. If a legal request of this nature is made, the UCD Director of Legal Services will assess the request, and if it is established that UCD by law or legal order is required to comply, the UCD Director of Legal Services will provide UCD IT Services with a completed 'Request Form for Legally Mandated Data Provision' to enable IT Services to progress the request.
- An account has been closed due to the former named Account Holder leaving UCD yet still wants the account to be reopened for personal reasons, which are not connected to UCD business operations.

## 4. Principles

HoU/HoS, as Requestor,

Exceptional Account Access Policy Legend

UCD Person or UCD Pparty requiring temporary access to data

Requestor in form or HoU or HoS

Approver in form of DPO or nominee

DO passes approved submission form on

to Service Owner

-    UCD person or UCD party initiates request by contacting the Requestor, i.e. Head of Unit (HoU) or Head of School (HoS) for the named Account Holder. In normal circumstances the HoU/HoS will in turn contact the named Account Holder to discuss the data access request. If deemed appropriate, the named Account Holder provides data to the UCD person or UCD party and the process comes to an end.
- In instances where the UCD person or UCD party needs access to the data and the named Account Holder cannot be reached, or is no longer with UCD, the Requestor (HoU/HoS) completes the Exceptional Account Access Request form and submits it to the Approver (DPO or nominee). The Requestor must provide the reason why access is required, what data needs to be accessed and what steps will be taken to protect the privacy of any personal data affected by the request, be it the named Account Holder's data, be it personal data covered by the proposed access. The request form needs to clearly state who in UCD will have access and who will supervise access, where appropriate. Only UCD employees can be granted access to UCD IT resources; access cannot be granted to non-UCD individuals.

Note: The Requestor cannot be both the Requestor and Approver for the same request.

- If the Approver (DPO or nominee) assesses the request to be outside the scope of the Exceptional Account Access Policy, or non-compliant with data protection law, the Requestor will be informed of same, and the application process ends.
- If the Approver approves the request, the approved form will be sent by the Approver directly to the appropriate UCD Service Owner to be actioned. For example, in the event that an employee member is absent and can't be contacted and their line manager requires access to their email to retrieve business information, the Approver will

send the approved request to IT Services to be actioned.

- The  UCD  Service  Owner  will  then  provide  the  Requestor  or  their  nominee  with  temporary access to  the  named  Account  Holder's  Data  for  the  specified  period  of  time.  In  the  above example, IT Services will provide the Requestor with the Account Holder's username and a temporary password.
- To protect the named Account Holder's privacy and the privacy of any data subjects affected by the request, the Requestor must ensure that the data access is carried out in accordance with the steps outlined in the Exceptional Account Access Policy and, where appropriate, supervised as indicated on the form.
- At the end of the specified period of time, the UCD Service Owner will remove the Requestor or their nominee's access by either resetting the named Account Holder's password or by removing privileges temporarily granted to the Requestor or nominee.
- After  the  request  is  complete,  the  Requestor  is  responsible  for  informing  the  named  Account Holder of the reasons why their data was accessed. If the named Account Holder's password was reset, then they will be required to contact the Service Owner to request a new password. This is only applicable to accounts where the named Account Holder is a current and not former UCD employee.
- Under this Exceptional Account Access Policy, each actioned request to access Data must be recorded  by  the  UCD  Policy  Owner,  i.e.  the  DPO  or  nominee  and  retained  for  record keeping/tracking  purposes for no less than 3 years.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

- Head of UCD School/Unit considers whether the data in the closed account is within scope of the policy, for example, is of importance to the School/Unit and their operations. If so, they identify who in  their  School/Unit is  the  person most appropriate to  be granted temporary access. Once the person is identified, the Head of School/Unit completes the request form and submits it to the DPO.
- DPO or nominee assesses the request from the point of view of data protection, and grants the requests in full, with limitations, or refuses the request. Granted requests are passed on by the DPO or nominee directly to the Service Owner, in most instances, this will be IT Services.
- IT Services, or relevant Service Owner, implement the request and enable temporary access to the data/account requested.
