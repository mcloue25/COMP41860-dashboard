## Job Sizing of Administrative Roles Policy

UCD Human Resources Acmhainní Daonna UCD

## 1. Purpose of Policy &amp; Definitions

Job sizing is the process by which the grade for a particular role is established.  It is an assessment of a role, not a person.

Job sizing is a management-initiated process, designed to align role design and work organisation with the operational needs of the University and ensure appropriate pay grades which recognise the value of the role.

## 2. Scope of the Policy

Job sizing arises in several different ways:

- When a new role is being created (temporary or permanent) with a duration of more than one year;
- When a vacancy arises in a role that has never been graded/sized;
- Where any changes are being   made to an existing  role  that has  become  vacant (updating/refreshing/future proofing)
- Where a temporary role of less than one year, that has never been graded/sized, is extended
- Where  a  role  that  has  not  been  graded  in  at  least  4  years  is  considered  by  the manager to have materially changed in a way that could affect the grade, and there is an incumbent who has 4+ years service in the role who will be able to benefit from promotion without competition if the role is deemed to be at a higher grade.

The accepted job sizing methodology for the University is outlined in Schedule A which reflects the  decisions  made  by  the  then  Job  Grading  Review  Committee  on  1  July  2009  with  the agreement of SIPTU.

The factors used when assessing a role are Work Complexity, Decision Making, Relationships, Capability, Impact and Supervision.  Work volume on its own is not a consideration in the job sizing process except where it materially changes one of the other factors on which a role is sized

## 3. Process for Referring a Role for Job Sizing

The  Job  Sizing  Committee  normally  meets  on  a  monthly  basis  throughout  the  year  and  the dates of their meetings and the latest date for receipt of applications is published on the HR website at http://www.ucd.ie/hr/a-z/jobgrading/

College  Principals/Heads  of  Schools/Units  will,  as  part  of  their  annual  budget  and  workforce planning  processes,  and  in  response  to  organisational  development  initiatives,  determine  the administrative and support structure most appropriate to their particular service delivery needs. They will take a formal Organisation Design approach to this, supported by their HR Partner.

## Job Sizing of Administrative Roles Policy

UCD Human Resources Acmhainní Daonna UCD

Where job sizing is required, the submission to the Committee must be made up of the following documents:

- A completed application form (where new) or a tracked changes application form where it is an existing role already sized. Application forms can be downloaded from the UCD HR website:  http://www.ucd.ie/hr/forms/
- A copy of the proposed job description (where new) or a tracked changes job description, where it is an existing role already sized. A job description template is available from the UCD HR website under http://www.ucd.ie/hr/forms/ job descriptions must be drafted in accordance with the university guidelines available from http://www.ucd.ie/hr/resourcing/
- A hierarchical organisational chart showing the position of the proposed new role and its relationship to other roles in the College/School/Unit and indicating the grades of each of the administrative roles in the College/School/Unit. For existing posts being reviewed, a similar organisation chart is required showing any changes in the organisational context in which the role operates, including changes to surrounding roles.

Incomplete applications, i.e. which do not contain the 3 documents listed above appropriately completed will not be submitted to the Committee, nor will additional documents be submitted unless expressly requested by the Committee as part of some clarification they have sought .

The  Job  Sizing  Committee  is  unable  to  accept  applications  which  are  not  received  by  each monthly deadline, due to volume and capacity considerations.

The effective date of the sizing of a role is the date the Committee reached a decision on it, normally the relevant meeting date.

## 4. The Role of the Job Sizing Committee

The  role  of  the  Job  Sizing  Committee  is  to  consider  all  requests  for  sizing  or  re-sizing  from College Principals/Heads of Schools/Units and to agree a grade for the role based on the Job description  and  application  details  submitted.  The  Committee  has  no  role  in  respect  of consideration of incumbents in roles which are being submitted with a view to promotion without competition.

The Job Sizing Committee ensures consistency in the application of job grades to administrative roles across the University, giving due  consideration to the roles, responsibilities  and requirements of particular roles and the organisational context of the work area.

The Job Sizing Committee will comprise the following membership:

- Head of School or other nominee of the President (Chair);
- Union representative;

## Job Sizing of Administrative Roles Policy

UCD Human Resources Acmhainní Daonna UCD

- Senior member of staff of UCD HR

The membership and structure of the Committee will be reviewed from time to time to ensure that gender representation is maintained.

The Committee may, by agreement, co-opt one other member where it is felt that the co-opted member's contribution would enhance the quality of the Committee's deliberations.

The Committee may, by agreement, substitute one Committee member at any given time.

The deliberations of the Job Sizing Committee are to remain confidential to the members of the Committee at  all  times.  The  formal  record  of  the  meeting  and  outcomes  will  be  a  document signed by the members of the Committee and indicating the agreed scoring and grade for each role on which a conclusion was reached.

Where a sizing request is perceived to present a conflict of interest for a member of the Job Sizing  Committee,  that  committee  member  should  excuse  themselves  from  the  deliberations and a substitution may be sought.

Where the members of the Job Sizing Committee are unable to reach agreement in relation to a particular  role  (either  re-sized  or  new),  the  Chair  of  the  Committee  will  refer  the  role  back  to UCD HR who will determine what action to take in conjunction with the local manager.

## The Role of UCD HR Promotions and Grading

The  UCD  HR  Promotions  and  Grading  office  is  responsible  for  the  overall  operation  and management of the process and specifically provides administrative support to the Job Sizing Committee.  It  is  also  the  centre  for  advice  on  the  Job  Families  Framework  and  provides guidance  on  how  to  incorporate  and  align  job  descriptions  with  the  approved  Job  Families Framework.

It will:

- Check all applications submitted for job sizing to ensure that all documents have been received and are completed ( see section 3 of this document for a list of documents to be presented )
- Forward all complete applications to the Job Sizing Committee for consideration at its next scheduled meeting
- Record the decisions made by the Job Sizing Committee at its meeting
- Communicate the decisions made by the Job Sizing Committee to the relevant College Principal/Head of School/ Unit
- Deal with all correspondence relating to the job sizing process
- Maintain a record of the sizing evaluation for each role considered

In addition, this office is responsible for providing an annual report and analysis of the patterns of applications and outcomes and making any recommendations that may be relevant for

enhancement or refinement of the process. It will review the process from time to time to assess its ongoing suitability in the context of the University's needs and will consult with stakeholders in relation to same.

## 5. The Role of the UCD HR Partner

The HR Partner may provide overall guidance to the College Principal/Head of School/Unit on staffing  strategies  within  the  University/College/School/Unit  and,    where  necessary,  direct  the College  Principal/Head  of  School/Unit  to  the  specialist  staff  in  UCD  HR,  Promotions  and Grading and UCD HR, Resourcing for procedural advice and guidance, as appropriate.

## 6. The Role of UCD HR Resourcing?

UCD HR Resourcing, on request, will be happy to give advice to the College Principal/Head of School/Unit on drafting the job description which forms part of the application for sizing a role. Please  refer  to  http://www.ucd.ie/hr/resourcing/  for  additional  information.  The  involvement  of UCD HR Resourcing in drafting a job description will not guarantee a particular grade when the application is reviewed by the Job Sizing Committee.

When  a  new  or  vacant  role  has  been  sized  by  the  Job  Sizing  Committee,  the  College Principal/Head of School/Unit should contact UCD HR Resourcing about advertising the role.

## Job Sizing Scheme Factors &amp; Degree Definitions

## Schedule A

## 1. FACTORS

Factors are the elements of the job against which it can be evaluated and assessed.  The six factors are:

- a.  Work Complexity

- d.    Capability

- b.  Decision Making

- e.    Impact

- c.  Relationships

- f.     Supervision

## 2. DEGREES

The six factors are further sub-divided into levels to give guidance in job scoring to the level of demand, e.g. low, medium or high as required under each factor in the scheme. Detailed definitions of both Factors and Levels are contained below.

## 3. OVERVIEW OF FACTORS AND LEVELS

## a.  WORK COMPLEXITY

This factor relates to the level of difficulty involved in the performance of the various tasks, which constitute the job . In some cases it may involve the use of equipment but generally it is concerned with organisation.

Complexity relates also to the range and depth of tasks; setting of priorities; handling of detail and issues arising from ability/capacity (as opposed to capability required to carry out a particular task) to appreciate and assist the academic and/or other objectives of the University or, where relevant, to help staff or students to attain their objectives.

|   LEVEL | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       1 | Activities comprising routine tasks of identical cycle with restricted and clearly defined range of outcomes and methods.                                                                                    |
|       2 | Standardised activities involving choice of action with limits specified by practice or instructions. Planning content and setting priorities within the limits of the job itself.                           |
|       3 | A range of tasks requiring a variety of skills and the exercise of initiative within clearly specified limits.                                                                                               |
|       4 | Working in a widely defined and reasonably complex area of activity. Work tasks encompassed would imply operating substantially without a well defined, predetermined range of actions. Work is performed in |

|    | an environment where there is an absence of known standards and, as a consequence, new standards have to be developed involving frequent exercise of responsibility and initiative.                                                                                                                         |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  5 | Job tasks ordinarily involving complex activities which impact/impinge on other areas and/or are fairly crucially related to key objectives of the University, i.e. performance or control of work of significant complexity or importance requiring an extensive measure of initiative and responsibility. |

## b.  DECISION MAKING

This factor relates to the necessity to take independent action . It involves the exercise of  a  choice  between  alternative  lines  of  action or,  where  relevant, the  giving  of advice on action to be taken, or courses to be followed, which in some circumstances, means advising on courses of action to be avoided.

The amount of supervision, given or received, has a bearing on the level of decisionmaking. Decisions may be uncomplicated, based on clear instructions or precedent or may require a little know how or experience of the tasks in hand.

Other decisions are carried out under more general directives and are concerned with their application to specific situations. More complex decisions require the co-ordination of  information,  the  use  of  judgement  and/or  initiative  and  are  generally  based  on complete information.

Decisions  of  a  significant  nature  are  taken  within  the  context  of  broad  organisational objectives and/or specified resources or in circumstances where the consequences are not totally predictable and require critical evaluation and a high level of judgement and/or initiative.

|   LEVEL | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       1 | Job is carried out under clearly set out instructions. Decisions are of a routine nature. Very little initiative required.                                                                                                     |
|       2 | Job is carried out under indirect supervision. Decisions are made relevant to the workings of the specific job. Initiative is used on a day-to-day basis.                                                                      |
|       3 | Job is carried out with little or no supervision. Decisions are made over a set range of issues (usually incorporating a specialised knowledge of University procedures) under broad general directives of a superior officer. |
|       4 | Job requires co-ordination of information from a wide variety of sources. Decisions are generally required to                                                                                                                  |

|    | be made on the basis of complex incomplete information. The synthesis of acquired specialised knowledge and 'know how' to deal with problems, people or situations is implied in this level. The demand level would be in excess of work such as appreciation of or normative application of University rules and procedures. A high level of responsibility and initiative is implied in job functions assigned.   |
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  5 | Job involves a designated responsibility for contributing to the process of policy formation and/or a key role in helping to set or contribute to corporate objectives. Decision-making is of a significant nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## c. RELATIONSHIPS

This  factor  deals  with  responsibility  for  dealing  with  other  people,  i.e.  interactions,  both inside and outside the organisation. It relates to those contacts which are essential for the  proper  performance  of  the  job. Contact  may  involve  imparting information, answering queries, making appointments or seeking facts or information required by the organisation.  They  also  include  contacts  with  individuals  or  groups  of  varying  levels  or interests  in  which  highly  developed  social,  persuasive,  counselling  or  other  interactive skills are necessary to carry out the work. The scope, level or frequency of any such relationships is  important  to  the  performance  of  the  job.  The  levels  should  give  due consideration to the frequency of contact, how it is made, whether it involves exchange of information or influencing or negotiating with others.

|   LEVEL | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|       1 | Contacts within a small group of staff in the same School/Unit or in similar jobs, or contact with a wide range of people on routine matters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|       2 | Dealing with a wider range of people, e.g. contacts necessitated by the provision of routine services to peers (inside/outside University), immediate supervisors, working colleagues (mainly non- controversial contacts with people). Contact with staff in different areas of the University or other organisations where information is exchanged and has to be relayed effectively. Contacts of a 'formalised' nature, e.g. may involve attendance at meetings or committees, mainly for the supply and exchange of information, may require executive/administrative follow-up/servicing of meetings. |
|       3 | Giving or receiving complex information and/or advice and guidance on a regular basis and analysing, applying and adapting that information, both inside and outside the University; may involve sensitive contacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Schedule B - Scoring System

## Determination of Job Sizing Outcomes

The job sizing methodology is outlined in Schedule A and is in accordance with the previously agreed  Job  Grading  Scheme.    The  methodology  may  be  reviewed,  following  consultation,  to ensure that it accurately reflects the demands of the family of jobs that it encompasses.

By applying the methodology, each evaluated role will be assigned a points rating indicating its relative work value.  Weighted points will be allocated as follows:

*The maximum number of points assignable against this factor is indicated in the column for level four.

## Half Integer Scores

Half integer scores are used in a very limited number of cases where the factor description does not correlate with the specific duties and responsibilities of the role in that the score appears lower than merited, and elevation to the next level is also deemed to be inappropriate.

Based on the assigned points rating, the following grades will be applied to administrative roles across the University:

| GRADE                                  | POINTS RANGE   |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| Senior Administrative Officer 4 (SA04) | 1,351 - 1,650  |
| Administrative Officer 1A (AO1A)       | 1,201 - 1350   |
| Administrative Officer 1 (AO1)         | 1,051 - 1,200  |
| Administrative Officer 2 (AO2)         | 901 - 1,050    |
| Senior Executive Assistant (SEA)       | 751 - 900      |
