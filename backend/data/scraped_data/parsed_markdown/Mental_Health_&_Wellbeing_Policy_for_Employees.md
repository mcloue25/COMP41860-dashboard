Policy owner:

Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion / Culture &amp; Engagement

## 1. Purpose

This policy sets out the University's commitment to supporting the mental health and wellbeing of employees in UCD as part of an overall responsibility to promote a healthy work environment where all aspects of health are championed. It is recognised that many of us will experience challenges to our mental health and wellbeing in our personal and work lives. It is the aim of the University to create a supportive, empathetic and positive environment which contributes to and fosters good mental health and wellbeing for all our colleagues.

We understand that mental health and wellbeing are impacted by a range of factors in our personal lives and at work and the University wants to create an environment where people feel safe to bring their whole selves to work. This policy seeks to promote a positive working environment that actively supports the mental health and wellbeing of employees, that helps to build resilience and provides support to those experiencing mental ill health and enables employees to reach their full potential. The University aims to create a culture of openness and honesty around mental health issues in the workplace, where everyone has a role to play in achieving this and to safeguard the mental health and wellbeing of all. The University recognises the importance of ensuring that all employees are able to work in a supportive, professional and caring environment, where they are valued and respected and treated equally in line with the University's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion policy.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all UCD employees.

## 3. Definitions

## Mental Health and Wellbeing

'A state of wellbeing is one in which the individual realises their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to their community. It is fundamental to our collective and individual ability as humans to think, emote,

interact, earn a living, and enjoy life ' . People move on a continuum ranging from good mental health 1 to mental ill health or disability and the support or interventions required will vary depending on where a person is on that continuum .

## Mental Ill Health

Mental ill health or mental health conditions are those that are clinically diagnosable and affects the way people think, feel, behave, or interact with others . There are many different mental illnesses or 2 mental health conditions, and they have different symptoms that impact people's lives in different ways. They may be more or less severe, and their treatment pathways may vary. As mental health is on a continuum, some may be experiencing the more severe illness end of the spectrum at times. Mental illnesses or mental health conditions (like all other health problems) are often episodic, meaning there are times ('episodes') of ill health and times of better or good mental health.

## Mental Health and Wellbeing Awareness

It is important that employees feel safe to make their manager aware of issues of a mental health nature if they wish to seek support. UCD recognises that having this conversation can be difficult, therefore it is extremely important that we seek to create a supportive environment which encourages employees experiencing mental health difficulties to discuss the supports that they would find helpful without the fear of stigma.

In addition to one's manager, there are a range of internal and external supports that individuals can speak to confidentially such as the Employee Assistance Service, Mental Health and Wellbeing Support Colleagues and Employee Networks. Further information is available in the Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion website section on mental health and wellbeing.

These discussions are welcomed by UCD as this ensures that the appropriate supports and accommodations, if necessary, can be put in place to allow individuals to participate fully and equally in all aspects of the University and to support them in their lives more broadly.

## Reasonable Accommodation

UCD is committed to working positively with anyone raising awareness about their mental health difficulties, so that we can identify what may help them to carry out their role as well as supporting their wellbeing more broadly. A clear process is in place for anyone who raises awareness about a mental health issue or any type of disability and wishes to seek support or a reasonable accommodation. Guidance for employees and managers on the request and provision of reasonable accommodations is available on the Equality Diversity &amp; Inclusion website. Reasonable Accommodations can be defined as some modification to tasks or the structure of a job or the workplace which allows an employee with a disability (mental health issue in this instance) to carry out their roles to as full capacity as possible and enjoy equal employment opportunities.
