Post Doctoral Fellow

## 1.  Introduction

Selection Point

The Senior Management Team has set out a policy framework to support research and early stage academic career structures and in doing so has defined two research roles in the new research career structure: Post-doctoral Research Fellow and Research Fellow.

Entry to the research career structure occurs following doctoral education. The structure outlines a pathway to a tenured academic position, while recognising that many of those entering the structure will exit to careers outside academia. The Post-doctoral period is a continuous period of training stretching over 2- 5 years in Humanities &amp; Social Sciences. The Research Fellow will typically involve the jobholder having an opportunity to manage his/ her own research programme and in the majority of cases the Fellow will be in receipt of a prestigious research award which would cover the cost of their salary and research. This role is similar to tenure- track in other jurisdictions. The role allows the Fellow to assemble a portfolio of independent achievement and render themselves competitive for tenured academic positions or other senior roles in enterprise.

## 2. Post -doctoral fellow in HSS - Contract Options

## 2.1 Roles

The Post Doctoral Fellowship in Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) has an expected duration of 2- 5 years. This period can be considered in two separate stages: Post Doctoral Fellow 1 and Post Doctoral Fellow II

Post-Doctoral Fellow I: The first years are typically marked with low levels of independence and the research is conducted largely under the direction of a tenured academic. The major emphasis is on the further development of the post-doctoral fellow's research skills and competences. The typical duration will be two years.

Post Doctoral Fellow II: This stage should provide a further 1-3 years of advanced on the job development and support. This period is marked by growing independence on the part of the Fellow, including the developing of his/her own research proposals and increased levels of responsibility around supervising and teaching of post doctoral and undergraduate students.

## 2.2 Standard Contract Durations for Post Doctoral Fellow - 1, 2 or 3 year contract

It is preferable for the Post Doctoral fellowship to be completed through a single contract spanning the entire period of the fellowship, or through a separate contract issued for each of the two stages. However, it is recognised that the funded programmes supported by exchequer and non exchequer funding can be of variable durations.  There are a range of standard contractual options to support the employment framework for Post-doctoral fellows which are set out in the table below, all of which refer to contracts of duration of one year or more. Section 2.3 provides details on the use of non standard contract, this is anything of 12 months duration or less with a minimum of 6 months.

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

The above table reflects the fact that the majority of funded programmes are for one or two years in HSS and that exact year contracts are preferred to split year contracts. However where the funding does not match an exact year duration, a contract matching the duration of the research funded programme may be offered. This allows for contracts of various durations between 18 months and 24 months, within the overall context of the 2 - 5 years total post doctoral phase.

A contract of longer duration than the funding indicates may be considered in order to achieve an exact year contract, for example to bridge the gap between 18 months of funding and a 24 month contract, this may be done where the PI is confident that any funding shortfall incurred by offering a longer contract can be addressed.

This will require additional sign off from the College Principal (CP) and College Finance Manager. To authorise this approval the CP will inform the Research Finance Office and only in these circumstances can a contract of employment extend beyond the duration of the research funded programme.

## 2.3. Non Standard Contracts - Post Doctoral Fellows - Contracts of Employment of less than 12 months with a minimum of 6 months.

Where the funded research programmes are of a duration of less than 12 months with a minimum of 6 months, and the risk of dismissal is likely if a standard contract of one year is issued (due to lack of availability of funds) the Principal Investigator (PI) can with the authorisation of the Head of School (HOS) and CP offer an non standard contract for a post doctoral fellow if the circumstances match one of the following exceptions

-  Where a specific skills set of required for less than one year only at Post -Doctoral I or Post Doctoral II level on a particular research programme
-  Where strategic funding for post doctoral role could be lost if future availability of funding is unpredictable e.g. Industry funding
-  Where the funding agency stipulates that the post doctoral contract be issued for less than 12 months
-  Where the contract is issued for a replacement for a post doctoral fellow who has resigned during a one year contract
-  Where the contract is issued to maternity leave
-  Where secondments apply.

All examples of contracts that are of less than 12 months that do not fit into these exceptions will need to go to the Budget Review Committee (BRC) for approval.

The mechanism for seeking BRC approval is as follows:

- In the first instance the HOS / Unit or CP can decline approval at local level if it is felt that the proposed contract is not strategically important.
- If the HOS /Unit or CP believe that the proposed contract may be of strategic importance then the Principal Investigator is requested to make a business case to the BRC.
- The PI will submit the business case/ Research Authorisation Form / Job Description to the HOS / Unit and onwards to the CP who will request the College Finance Manager to bring to the attention of the BRC. The College Finance Manager will retain copies of the documentation.
- Outcome will be communicated from the BRC (email) to the College Finance Manager who will in turn update (email) the CP and HOS/ Unit.
- If approved the RAF/ JD will be progresses as normal by the College Office (with email approval from the BRC attached).

## 2.4. Extensions of Post-doctoral Fellow II contract

This applies to the Post Doctoral Fellows employed prior to the implementation of the UCD Careers Framework in October 2010. Where ongoing research funding is available within their existing specific project or programme, these fellows can be offered a fixed term contract of sufficient duration to complete their training at their current level. This contract will be deemed to complete their training at their current Post Doctoral level with UCD.

Those completing PDI level will be able to compete for PDII positions advertised within UCD. If it is a contract to complete PDII level there will be no possibility of further employment at UCD as a post doctoral fellow on the expiration of the period of the new contract.

## 2.5. Bespoke contract arrangement for Post-doctoral Research Fellow Level II.

In exceptional circumstances where a 4 year programme of funding arises, which is deemed to require a level II Post-doc on commencement, a vacancy may be advertised as follows:  A 4 year programme of work is required on the particular research project.  A vacancy exists for a Post Doctoral Research Fellow - Level II  The successful candidate will initially be employed on a 2 year contract.  Subject to satisfactory performance and outputs related to the research aspects of the role and including satisfactory skill and competency development in line with the UCD Research Skills and Career Development framework, a second 2 year contract will be available to the individual at PDII level or in the case of outstanding performance, and as assessed against the UCD Research Fellow Criteria, at Research Fellow level.

In order to advertise in this manner, approval will be required from Head of School, Vice Principal for Research and Innovation and College Principal.

## 3.1 Routes to Research Fellow and Associated Approval Mechanisms

There will be three routes to Research Fellow status:

1.  A  prestigious  independent  funding  award  to  an  individual  following  a  competitive,  peerreviewed process.
2.  A  decision  that  a  particular  programme  of  work,  on  a  large,  complex  research  project requires the appointment of someone at Research Fellow level to lead that work under the direction of the PI/Grant-holder. In this case the post will be advertised.
3.  Arising from the advertisement of a post with a bespoke contract arrangement and following successful review against the RF criteria.

The UCD Research Fellow assessment criteria, as approved by the SMTA will inform all individual assessment decisions.

## 4. Other fixed Term Roles

For all other fixed term roles the standard UCD guidelines and objective grounds apply (note UCD authentication required).

A key principle is that fixed term contract should be issued for the longest possible duration relative to the actual need and funding available. Short term contracts should not be issued with a view to renewal or extension.
