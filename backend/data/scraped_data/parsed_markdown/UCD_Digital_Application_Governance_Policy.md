## UCD Digital Application Governance Policy

Policy Owner:

IT Services

Approval Body &amp; Date:

UMT 16th Dec 2025

## 1. Purpose

Good governance of UCD's digital applications is essential to ensure that digital investments, resources and  transformation  efforts  are  aligned  with  the  University's  priorities -supporting  UCD's  strategic initiatives, operational efficiency and enhanced user experience; safeguarding UCD against risks and cyberthreats; and enabling UCD to meet regulatory and legislative obligations.

The purpose of the Digital Governance Policy is to provide clear governance structures that guide the delivery and deployment of digital applications in UCD's environment as well as providing guardrails for their ongoing management and support, in line wit h the University's strategic goals and compliance obligations.

A key objective is to ensure that all proposed digital applications are assessed for alignment with UCD's Enterprise  Architecture  Principles  before  acquisition  and are  registered  in  the  University's  central applications register. Only applications registered with IT Services should be deployed for use in UCD.

This policy should be read in conjunction with UCD's IT Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) which covers the use of IT resources, including but not limited to applications and technologies, by all staff, students, or other users, including third party users, whether they are physically located on campus or accessing IT resources remotely regardless of geographic location.

## 2. Terms and Definitions

Digital Application -subsequently referred to as ' Application ' in the context of this document -is a digital  solution  that  provides  functionality  to  UCD's  community,  typically  accessed  through  a  web browser, mobile device, or desktop, or that provides functionality or capabilities to other applications.

Applications include on-premises hosted and cloud services; bespoke and package solutions; internally managed and externally managed by a third party; subscription and perpetual paid licences as well as free or open-source solutions.

Each application is categorised according to its scale:

- University wide - a solution that is implemented for use across multiple units or schools.
- Local - a solution that is implemented for use in one school or unit.

Additionally, applications fall into one of three classes based on their purpose.

- Enabling Applications Solutions supporting specific functions and activities enabling UCD's business capabilities and processes.

- Infrastructure Applications - Solutions that support technical operations and processes within UCD.
- Learning/Teaching Applications -  Course/discipline-specific software packages, supporting teaching and learning, or taught research in particular academic domains or modules.

Business Capabilities represents what UCD does to achieve a specific business purpose or outcome. Capabilities  support  the realisation  of  the  organisation's  strategies.  UCD  has  aligned  to  the  Higher Education Reference Model (HERM) Business Capability Model 1 , as its reference model for describing Business Capabilities.
