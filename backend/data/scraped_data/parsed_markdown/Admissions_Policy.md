ACEC  1 March 2023

## 1  Purpose

University College Dublin admits students to accredited programmes from NFQ level 6 to level 10 and at various stages within these programmes. This is a broad framework policy which sets out how the University admits students and where the authority to do so is vested. The Policy covers the overarching general principles adopted by the University and underpins other policies and procedures relevant to the Admissions process 1 .

## 2  Scope

The Policy applies to applicants and UCD staff involved in the admissions process for UCD programmes. This Policy does not apply to UCD recognised Colleges.

## 3  Principles

- The University is committed to fair, transparent and consistent admissions practices and procedures,
- The University aims to attract and retain an excellent and diverse cohort of students. It upholds UCD's strategic commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI), supporting the pursuit of inclusivity strategies and alternative access routes.
- Admission is subject to meeting minimum entry requirements and the availability of places.
- Offers are subject to the University's published Terms and Conditions of Offer.

## 3.1  Selection and Communication of Decisions

## General Criteria

Specific programme requirements are published as follows:

- The UCD Admissions, UCD Student Recruitment and UCD Global websites
- Prospectuses for Undergraduate and Graduate programmes.

As printed materials are produced well in advance of commencement of the programme, the website should be referred to for updated information about programme content and application criteria. The University will give adequate notice of changes to programme entry requirements.

In addition, the following apply to all applicants

## Age Requirements

Students admitted to UCD must normally be seventeen years of age by 15 January following entry. However, the Registrar may grant dispensation for younger students to be admitted.

Under-18 international students (i.e. non-EU) are required to provide proof of guardianship in advance of registration.

## English Language Requirements

As English is the teaching language of the University applicants whose first language is not English are required to produce evidence of proficiency in accordance with the UCD English Language Requirements.

## Assessment of Applicants

Admission is at the discretion of the relevant admitting authority in accordance with approved entry criteria; primarily on academic merit but may incorporate other factors. These may include, but are not limited to:

- References
- An interview;
- Submission of a curriculum vitae or résumé;
- Submission of a portfolio of work; or
- An additional external test score (e.g. GAMSAT/HPAT)

Applying for a place does not guarantee that an offer will be made. Where there are restrictions on the number of places that the University can make available, competition can often be extremely high.

The University cannot fairly and consistently take account of any special circumstance affecting an applicant's performance in pre-entry qualifications. Such circumstance should be made known to the relevant examination body.

Offers for taught programmes will not be made after the third week of a twelve week trimester 2 . Where results are received later than this due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, a deferred offer may be issued.

## Notification of Decisions

Applicants will be notified of the outcome of their application promptly after the decision is made, Offers are made with a specific timeline for acceptance. Offers which are not accepted or deferred by the acceptance date will lapse and may no longer be available to the applicant.

Where an applicant accepts a subsequent offer, this will supersede the acceptance of the earlier offer. Candidates cannot hold two or more acceptances simultaneously.

Unsuccessful applicants have a right to receive feedback on their application from the School, College or Unit responsible for the admissions decision. However, it may not always be possible to provide highly specific or tailored advice.

Communication specific to an application will be conducted in line with our published privacy statement.

UCD reserves the right to verify information provided. If documents are found to have been falsified, the awarding body will be notified and, if an offer has issued, it may be withdrawn in line with UCD Terms &amp; Conditions of Offer.

## Discretion to Refuse Admission

In addition to the policies listed in the appendix, the University, in its absolute discretion, may refuse admission to an applicant where it believes that the applicant:

- has previously been excluded from the University for any reason;
- is currently indebted to the University;
- has been excluded or had their enrolment cancelled at another Higher Education Institution (HEI);
- is deemed a non-genuine temporary entrant;
- may prejudice the reputation, management, governance or discipline of the University;
- has engaged in dishonest and/or deceitful behaviour in the process of applying for admission to the University or any other HEI;

2  Or pro rata if the trimester is a different length

- would not be able to lawfully enter University premises for all or part of the duration of a programme by reason of a court order;

An applicant may also be refused admission following a risk assessment under the University's Relevant Offence Risk Assessment policy.

## 3.2  Interaction between the University and the Applicant

The University is committed to ensuring that any interaction with an applicant, or any enquirer, is conducted in a professional, courteous and respectful manner. The University will support staff in managing situations where this is not reciprocated.

## Complaints and Appeals

UCD aims to provide a high standard and quality of service for applicants. Applicants are entitled to make a complaint if they are not satisfied with the service they have received.

An applicant is entitled to appeal an admission decision, if they can demonstrate that the assessment of the application was based on incorrect process or/and where the decision was based on misinterpretation of information provided as part of the application process.
