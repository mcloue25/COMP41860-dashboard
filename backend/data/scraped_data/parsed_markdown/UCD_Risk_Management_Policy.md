## Risk Management Policy

Policy owner

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to affirm the University ' s commitment to providing a framework that allows for the identification, assessment, management, monitoring and reporting of risk.

The management of risk by the University is necessary in order to -

- o Support the strategic objectives of the University
- o Achieve operational objectives
- o Protect the University community
- o Ensure financial sustainability
- o To comply with the requirements of the HEA Code of Governance for Irish Universities.

Detailed risk management provisions, guidance documents, templates and training materials are to be found in the documents referred to below and at www.ucd.ie/riskmanagement

## 2. Definitions

- o Risk: The  potential  effects  of  uncertain  influences  on  the  achievement  of  objectives.  Risk  / Uncertainty can have a negative or a positive impact on the University 's objectives. By managing /  minimising  /  exploiting  uncertainty  the  University  can  achieve  its  strategic  and  operational objectives and enhance sustainability. Risks can be financial, strategic, reputational, compliance related, etc.
- o Risk Management: How the University manages risk / uncertainty.
- o Risk  Management  Framework: The  totality  of  the  University 's  integrated  risk  management measures.
- o Risk  Category :  A  high  level  description  of  the  various  categories  of  risks  that  can  arise  within University operations, for example Reputational or Financial Risks.
- o Risk Appetite : The level of risk or uncertainty that the University is willing to accept in the pursuit of its strategic objectives. It is descriptive in nature, e.g. having a Low Risk Appetite. Different

categories  of  risks  will  have  a  different  risk  appetite  associated  with  them.  For  example  the University  has  a  very  low  tolerance  for  risks  that  impact  on  financial  sustainability;  whilst  the University 's acceptance of risks associated with internationalisation projects is higher. Refer to the University's Risk Appetite Framework for further information.

- o Risk Appetite and Risk Category can be linked together in a descriptive way, for example by stating that the University has a Low Risk Appetite for Financial Risks; or a Moderate to High Risk Appetite for Strategic Initiative Risks.
- o Risk Score: The numerical score applied to a risk using a combination of likelihood (the chance of an event occurring) and impact (the outcome of the event).
- o Risk Tolerance is  the  maximum level of risk that the  University is comfortable accepting for a particular Risk Category expressed as a number.
- o Risk Appetite , Risk Category and Risk Tolerance can be linked, for example the University has a Low Risk Appetite for Financial Risks with a Risk Tolerance Score of 15.
- o Risk  Treatment  /  Risk  Mitigation measures  are  actions  designed  to  reduce  a  risks  score  by addressing at least one of two variables that make up that score (likelihood and impact).
- o Risk Rating is a descriptive term (Red, Amber or Green) used to describe a risk based on its Risk Score and the associated Risk Tolerance .
- o Risk Velocity is the 'time to impact' for a particular risk once it begins to emerge or develop and is descriptive in nature, e.g. risks that are considered to have a 'Fast Velocity' are those that can emerge over a matter of weeks with very limited early warning.
- o Inherent &amp; Residual Risk Risks are assessed on an inherent (i.e. considering current risk mitigation measures) and residual (i.e. considering any additional mitigation measures that could be put in place) basis. Therefore there are two risk scores for any one risk on a Risk Register.
- o Risk  Register: A  repository  for  details  of  risks,  risk  control  measures,  risk  ratings  and  other information related to risk management.
- o Risk Owners and Action Owners: All identified risks are assigned a Risk Owner and an Action Owner, with the former ultimately accountable for the risk and the latter responsible for ensuring ongoing  management  of  each  risk.  At  a  strategic  and  organisational  level  Risk  Owners  are members of the UMT; at a local level within a School or a Unit or a Project the Risk Owner is the relevant Head of School or Unit or Project Manager. Action Owners are those persons tasked by the Risk Owner with ensuring that the control measures identified are implemented.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all Colleges, Schools, Research Institutions and Units within the University and across all areas of operations. The entirety of the organisations activities are subject to this policy.

It also applies to the operations of the University

## 4. Principles

## 4.1 Risk Management Principles

UCD's Risk Management Framework is designed to assist the University in identifying, measuring, monitoring,  reporting  and  managing  risks  as  the  University  works  toward  achieving  its  strategic objectives.

To this end the University is guided by the principles of risk management as laid down in International Standard ISO:31000 Risk Management Guidelines. In summary these are -

- o Risk management is an integral part of activities
- o The  approach  to  risk  management  is  structured,  comprehensive,  dynamic  and  mindful  of organisational culture
- o Processes are proportionate and aligned with the degree of risk
- o Stakeholders are consulted and involved in risk management
- o Decisions are made using the best available data
- o There is a commitment to continuous improvement

## 4.2 The UCD Risk Management Process

The risk management process at UCD comprises four main steps:

- o Risk Identification
- o Risk Assessment and Evaluation
- o Implementation of Control Measures
- o Monitoring and Control

's wholly owned subsidiary companies.

Further  detailed  information  on  the  Risk  Management  Process  can  be  found  in  the  UCD  Risk Management Handbook

## 4.3 The Three Lines of Defence Model of Risk Management

UCD operates a 'Three Lines of Defence' model of risk management. Within the University the 'T hree Lines of Defence ' are identified as:

- o Line 1 -The Unit that owns the risk. In UCD there are layers of risk owners, starting at Unit / School / Project Level and moving upward via College / UMT Function level to the Enterprise Level Risk which is owned by the UMT.
- o Line 2 -The second line of defence are those specialist functions that provide oversight and / or guidance around risk management. These include the Risk Management Office, but also other key specialist functions such as UCD Legal, UCD Quality Office, UCD Safety, UCD HR, etc.
- o Line 3 -Those who provide independent oversight of the risk management framework, namely the Audit and Risk Management Committee (on behalf of the Governing Authority) and Internal Audit.

For further details on the Three lines of Defence Model refer to the UCD Risk Management Handbook

## 4.4 Risk Management Reporting

The Chief Risk Officer will provide updates on the effectiveness of the University 's Risk Management Framework  to  the  University  Management  Team  at  least  once  per  semester;  to  the  Governing Authority at least twice per year; and will at the discretion of the Committee Chair attend and report to all meetings of the Audit and Risk Management Committee.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

- o Governing Authority The Governing Authority has ultimate responsibility for risk and internal control within the University.

- o Audit and Risk Management Committee A  subcommittee of the Governing Authority which advises the latter on risk management issues and on the strategic processes for risk management in UCD.
- o President and the University Management Team The President and the UMT are responsible for the executive management of risk at a strategic and organisational level. The President and UMT maintain  an  Enterprise  Level  Risk  Register  setting  out  the  most  important  risks  for  the institution as a whole.  The President and UMT have primary responsibility for the identification and management of these risks.  Each of the risks identified has a Risk Owner who is a member of the UMT.
- o College  Principals: Primary  responsibility  for  the  management  of  risk  within  a  College  and  its constituent schools lies with the College Principal. Through the College Executive Committee, the College Principal will ensure that risks are managed and reported effectively. A Risk Register(s) will be  maintained  for  the  College  setting  out  the  important  risks.  Each  of  the  risks  identified  is assigned a Risk Owner who is a member of the College Executive Committee and an Action Owner who possesses the relevant knowledge/expertise to manage the risk on an ongoing basis.  The risk registers in place at the College level will align as appropriate with the high-level risks identified in the UMT Enterprise Level Risk Register(s). At the discretion of the College Principal a single Risk Register can be maintained across the College or multiple School / Research Unit risk registers can be maintained. The Risk Management Office can advise on this.
- o Vice  Presidents  /  Directors  of  Support  Units  (UMT  Level): Primary  responsibility  for  the management  of  risk  within  a  UMT members'  p ortfolio  lies  with  the  relevant  UMT  member. Working with their Senior Executive Team, the UMT member will ensure that risks are managed and reported effectively. A Risk Register(s) will be maintained for the UMT members portfolio setting out  the  important risks.  Each of  the  risks  identified  is  assigned  a  Risk  Owner  who  is  a member  of  the  Senior  Executive  Team  and  an  Action  Owner  who  possess  the  relevant knowledge/expertise to manage the risk on an ongoing basis.  The Risk Registers in place at the UMT  member  level  will  align  as  appropriate  with  the  high-level  risks  identified  in  the  UMT Enterprise Level Risk Register(s). At the discretion of the UMT member a single Risk Register can be maintained across the portfolio or multiple Unit risk registers can be maintained. The Risk Management Office can advise on this.
- o Heads of Schools / Unit Heads / Project Managers: Day to day responsibility for the management of risk within a School or Unit or Project rests with the Head of School / Head of Unit / Project Manager. Such persons should ensure that they liaise with their UMT Manager on a regular basis

and provide information necessary for the development of their Project / School / UMT Function Risk Register. Such persons are encouraged to promote a culture of risk management at a local level by developing  Project / School / Unit level Risk Registers and ensuring that staff have access to risk management training. Assistance on this can be obtained from the Risk Office.

- o All Faculty and Staff Members: All faculty and staff have a critical role to play in risk management. Employees of the University are expected to effectively manage risk within their own areas of responsibility and report risks having wider potential impact or requiring broader coordination and response to their line manager.
- o Risk Management Office : Led by the Chief Risk Officer, the Risk Management Office is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the University 's Risk Management Framework and providing advice, guidance and training to cohorts of person across the University.
- o Risk Management Advisory Committee: The University 's Risk Management Advisory Committee (RMAC) is the University 's management level risk committee and is a key part of the organisations Three Lines of Defence Risk Management Framework. At a high level its function is to guide and oversee the implementation of the University 's Risk Management Framework via the Chief Risk Officer, in particular the processes that support the identification, assessment, management and reporting of risk.
