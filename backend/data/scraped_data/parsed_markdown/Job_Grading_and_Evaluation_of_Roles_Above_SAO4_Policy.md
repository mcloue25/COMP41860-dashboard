## Hay Evaluation Policy

<!-- image -->

Policy owner: UCD HR

Approval date and body: UMT

28 February 2023

## 1. Purpose

Hay Evaluation is the methodology used to evaluate new and existing roles above the Senior Administrative IV Grade (or equivalent). Hay Evaluation can also be used to assess non-scale or hybrid posts.

Posts will be evaluated if they are fully authorised and submitted with support from both local and College / Vice President level management. New posts may on occasion require an additional layer of authorisation at university level and this process will be communicated as necessary.

## 2. Scope

This Policy applies to the evaluation of all new roles above SAO4 and the re-evaluation of an existing role at SAO4 or above prior to advertising.  It will also apply to non-scale or hybrid roles on request.

## 3. Principles

- 3.1 The Head of School/Unit will complete the Hay Evaluation form and submit it along with associated documentation including a job description and organisation chart to the Resourcing Manager.
- 3.2 HR will then convene a Hay Evaluation Committee to evaluate the role.  The committee contains a minimum of three evaluators who have all been trained in the Hay Evaluation methodology.
- 3.3 On occasion it may be determined by HR that a role will require external evaluation and any cost associated with this will be borne by the School or Unit.
- 3.4 On completion of the technical evaluation process, the Head of School/Unit will be advised by HR of the outcome.
- 3.5 Non-scale or hybrid roles may be aligned to an appropriate administrative scale following evaluation.

## 4. Roles and responsibilities

Head of School/Unit: Will prepare and submit requests in line with the details above.

Evaluation Committee: Trained member of staff in HR who will collectively undertake the evaluation process.
