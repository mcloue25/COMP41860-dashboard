## 4. Principles

4.1 Commitment To Workplace Safety

University College Dublin believes that no person should suffer an accident or ill health whilst at work or as a result of any operations carried out by, or on behalf of the University.

The  University  is  committed  to  ensuring  a  healthy  and  safe  working  environment  and continuous improvement of our practises through:

- The continuous assessment and management of all hazards that pose a risk to health and safety
- The provision of suitable training and information to employees
- The provision and maintenance of safe equipment
- The provision of adequate welfare facilities
- The provision of safe access and egress to the workplace
- The provision of safety competent co-workers
- The provision of safe systems of work
- The preparation of emergency plans
- The facilitation of worker representation and consultation in matters of safety
- The ongoing review of workplace safety
- The adherence to statutory obligations
- The management of the use of hazardous materials
- The protection of vulnerable and sensitive risk groups. Under health and safety legislation vulnerable and sensitive persons are those persons who by virtue of personal status or the type of work they undertake or a combination of both, may be at a greater risk from workplace hazards, e.g. pregnant employees, disabled workers, night workers, etc.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

In order to ensure a safe working environment for all the cooperation of all University staff is essential. Detailed functionary specific responsibilities with respect to health and safety within the University are outlined in the University Parent Safety Statement. The duties of the various functionaries within UCD can be summarised as follows:

Vice Presidents / College Principals / Functional Area Managers / Line Managers

The above are responsible for ensuring or making arrangements (for example via a nominee) to ensure that the activities undertaken within their areas of responsibility are carried out in a safe manner without undue risk to the health and safety of University employees, students or any third parties.

The attention of such persons is drawn to Regulation 80(1) of the  Safety, Health and Welfare At Work Act 2005 which states that 'Where an offence under any of the relevant statutory provisions has been committed by an undertaking and the doing of the acts that constituted the offence has been authorised, or consented to by, or is attributable to connivance or neglect on the part of, a person, being a director, manager or other similar officer of the undertaking, or a person who purports to act in any such capacity, that person as well as the undertaking shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished as if he or she were guilty of the first-mentioned offence.' Consequently there is a significant legal liability  placed  upon  all  managers  or  persons  who  act  as  managers  to  ensure  that  all operations under their control are carried out safely.

## Employees

All employees are legally required to work in a safe manner and not to endanger their own health and safety or that of any of their co-workers.
