## Use of Animals for Research &amp; Teaching Policy

Policy owner

Research Ethics Committee Approval date and body

UMT, 4 th  November 2025

## 1. Purpose

UCD is committed to ensuring that all members of the UCD Community involved in the use of animals for any purposes treat those animals with respect and consideration. Animals form a valuable part of the research and teaching activity of the university. The use of animals for research makes a valuable contribution  to  the  understanding  and  development  of  therapies  for  both  human  and  animal  health problems and to improvements/efficiencies in animal production systems. Although alternative in-vitro and computer modelling methods have enabled researchers to reduce studies involving animals in some instances, the use of animals for medical and scientific research is still essential. UCD uses animals for research where there are no alternatives. UCD also uses animals for teaching in order to pass on knowledge to students. UCD ensures that the handling, husbandry and welfare of animals follow the university's best practice procedures as issued by the Animal Research Ethics Committee, the Animal Welfare Body and the Designated Veterinarians.

The principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) underpin all animal related work carried out at the University, thereby ensuring that the number of animals used is minimised and that procedures and care are refined and regularly reviewed to maximise animal welfare.

## 2. Definitions

## 'UCD Community' means:

- o all UCD employees, whether part time or full time, permanent or temporary;
- o all employees of UCD's wholly -owned subsidiary companies or overseas campus/offices;
- o all registered students of UCD;
- o non-University employees who use University funds, facilities or other resources, including the  University's  name  and  reputation,  to  carry  out  teaching  and/or  research,  and/or participate in UCD-administered research, including retired employees, visiting faculty and researchers;  consultants,  contractors,  affiliated  hospital  staff,  industrial  personnel  and research fellows, regardless of obligations to other companies or institutions; and
- o all persons conducting teaching and/or research at or under the auspices of UCD including at any of UCD's overseas campus, including visiting faculty and researchers; consultants; contractors, Emeritus or adjunct appointments; and research fellows.

Research Ethics Committee (REC) The REC oversees and advises on policy regarding the work carried out by the sub-committees (see below). The REC facilitates and promotes research in UCD based on internationally accepted ethical norms and with attention to the welfare of study subjects and participants.

Animal Research Ethics Committee (AREC) A sub-committee of the REC which reviews protocols for research projects involving protected live animals, as well as teaching work involving live animals by  members  of  the  UCD  Community  or  on  UCD  premises,  in  order  to  ensure  best  practice  and compliance with relevant legislation and humane treatment of animals.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is  designated in legislation as the competent authority responsible for pharmacovigilance in Ireland and regulates medicines and devices for the benefit  of  people  and  animals.  Of  particular  relevance,  the  HPRA  is  responsible  for  regulating  and enforcing  EU  and  national  legislation  on  the  protection  of  animals  used  for  scientific  purposes  in Ireland in  compliance  with  Directive  2010/63/EU  and  S.I.  543  of  2012  (as  amended).  Under  that legislation every Establishment using animals for scientific purposes must have the following:-

- a) Compliance Officer(s): a suitably qualified person, responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of these Regulations.
- b) Designated Veterinarian(s): a  veterinarian  with  expertise  in  laboratory  and/or  farm  animal medicine,  charged  with  advisory  duties  in  relation  to  the  well-being  and  treatment  of  the animals.
- c) Animal Care and Welfare Officer(s): a person who is responsible for overseeing the welfare and care of the animals in the establishment, and ensuring that the staff dealing with animals have access to information specific to the species housed in the establishment.
- d) Training Officer(s ): a person responsible for ensuring that the staff are adequately educated, competent and continuously trained and that they are supervised until they have demonstrated the requisite competence.
- e) Animal Welfare Body (AWB) - an internal body charged, via a list of responsibilities in S.I. 543 of  2012,  with  protecting  the  welfare  of  animals  used  for  scientific  purposes.  In  UCD  this  is comprised of three Animal Welfare Sub-Committees (AWSCs) -one each for Belfield, for Lyons Farm and for Teaching activities.

Additional  to  the  statutory  requirements,  UCD  also  has  an  internal Animal  Welfare  Compliance Committee (AWCC), chaired by a senior scientist and additionally comprising the Compliance Officer/s for Lyons Farm and Belfield and one nominated Scientist/Veterinarian from each of the AWSCs. The AWCC is responsible  for  the  monitoring  of  compliance  with  S.I.  543  of  2012,  the  investigation  of suspected cases of non-compliance, and for informing UCD, via the VP for Research, Innovation and Impact, of any compliance-related issues that need to be addressed at an institutional level.

## 3. Scope

All research and teaching activities involving protected live animals that are carried out by members of the UCD Community (whether on or off campus) or by external personnel operating on UCD premises, require ethical review and approval and are subject to this policy as well as the UCD Research Ethics Policy and the Code of Good Practice in Research with Humans and Animals. This policy is intended to give an overview of the applicable statutory and institutional requirements.

## 4. Statutory Requirements

In Ireland, research and teaching activities involving all animals considered to be sentient are governed by Statutory Instrument No. 543 of 2012 (under Directive 2010/63/EU on the Protection of Animals used for Scientific Purposes) (hereafter S.I. 543 of 2012). The Statutory Instrument specifically excludes nonexperimental  agricultural  and  clinical  veterinary  practices  as  well  as  practices  undertaken  for  the

purposes  of  recognised  animal  husbandry  -  hence  these  are  all  excluded  from  the  scope  of  this document.

Compliance of research and teaching involving all species covered by S.I. 543 of 2012 is monitored onsite  by  designated  University  staff -these  include  the  Compliance  Officers,  the  Designated Veterinarians, the Animal Care and Welfare Officers and the Animal Welfare Body (AWB).

All units carrying out research or teaching involving the use of animals are also subject to audits by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA). Any individual performing a procedure on an animal regulated by S.I. 543 of 2012 requires the following to be legally compliant:-

- a) An Individual and a Project authorisation from the HPRA.
- b) Relevant training acceptable to the Compliance Officer(s).
- c) Signed-off  demonstration of procedural competency as  overseen by a designated  Training Officer.

## 5. Principles

The  university  actively  supports  the  implementation  of  the  three  R's  (Replacement,  Reduction  and Refinement), on which EU Directive 2010/63 and S.I. 543 of 2012 on the Protection of Animals used for Scientific Purposes are based. Additionally, all those working with animals are expected to always show  respect  and  empathy  for  the  animals  and  responsible  adherence  to  statutory  and  ethical requirements.

UCD  expects  all  use  of  animals  to  be  governed  by  the  five  principles: Replacement,  Reduction, Refinement, Respect, and Responsibility .

## 5.1 Replacement

Applications for ethical approval must first satisfy the AREC that the research or teaching activity has intrinsic  value. They must demonstrate that they have explored all alternative options not involving animals and that the use of animals is essential for their work. Members of the UCD Community must always strive to use non-animal alternatives and to give active support to the development and uptake of  such  alternatives;  they  must  also  engage  on  an  ongoing  basis  with  their  peers  to  advance replacement options.

## 5.2 Reduction

Applicants must justify the numbers of animals requested, and, in the case of animals to be used for research purposes, this must be done by robust statistical analysis. Every research application to the AREC must undergo review by a statistician sitting on the committee before it is approved. Additionally applicants  must  demonstrate  that  they  will  maximise  the  amount  of  data  emerging  from  animal experiments by judicious experimental design or, where the use of animals is for teaching, that they will  maximise  the  educational  value  of  the  animals  used  by  application  of  appropriate  educational techniques, including the use of video material.

## 5.3 Refinement

Animal  welfare  must  be  prioritised  when  designing  and  carrying  out  experiments  and  also  when teaching. This is ensured by applying high standards of training and education to members of the UCD Community as well as creating a culture of care and respect for the animals. Animal welfare must also be a priority in the provision of living space, nutrition and day-to-day care for the animals. Animal welfare must  be  prioritised  when  designing  experiments  and  teaching,  and  by  the  application  of  modern methods of anaesthesia and analgesia.

## 5.4 Respect

- 5.4.1 Members of the UCD Community working with animals must always be mindful that the animals they are using are sentient creatures and that they must be treated with care and respect at all times.  They  must  remember  that  being  permitted  to  use  animals  for  research  or  teaching purposes is a privilege granted by society and that with this comes distinct personal ethical and legal responsibilities.
- 5.4.2 Members  of  the  UCD  Community  must  design  their  experiments  or  teaching  classes accordingly,  monitor  the  animals'  wellbeing  diligently  and  notify  animal  care  staff  or  the Designated Veterinarian without delay if problems arise. If indicated, they must also use the formal  reporting  mechanisms to report such events to the Animal Welfare Body and/or the AREC.
- 5.4.3 Members of the UCD Community who have concerns about any aspect of the use of animals can and should report these to one of the Animal Care and Welfare Officers or to one of the Designated Veterinarians. Any such reports will be dealt with appropriately and with discretion.

## 5.5 Responsibility

- 5.5.1 All those working with live animals must always operate in a responsible fashion and take care to remain compliant with the legal and ethical requirements placed upon them. They must be aware of and operate to the following at all times:
- a) They must be familiar with, and in full compliance with, the requirements of S.I. 543 of 2012.
- b) They must be familiar with the terms of their individual and project authorisations granted to them and must remain in compliance with the requirements placed upon them by the HPRA.
- c) They  must  be  familiar  with  AWB  and  AREC  procedures  and  the  terms  of  any  ethical permissions granted to them and must remain in compliance with the requirements placed upon them by both bodies.
- d) They must be properly trained, and signed-off as being competent by the Training Officer, on any procedure/s or euthanasia methods that they wish to carry out.
- 5.5.2 If they are in doubt about any of the above, they must not proceed until they have made the necessary checks.
- 5.5.3 If they discover that they have been in non-compliance with any of the above, they must inform the relevant Compliance Officer without delay.
- 5.5.4 Members of the UCD Community should note that failure to conduct research or teaching in conformity with good practice or approval decisions or statutory authorisations may amount to misconduct within the meaning of the UCD Research Integrity Policy or of the UCD Student Code.

## 6. Roles and responsibilities

## 6.1 Animal Research Ethics Committee (AREC)

UCD's Animal Research Ethics Committee (AREC) is a sub -committee of the University's Research Ethics Committee (REC). It is charged with maintaining a comprehensive overview of all animal-based research and teaching activity carried out by members of the UCD Community in order to ensure best practice,  compliance  with  relevant  legislation  and  humane  treatment  of  animals.  It  does  this  (in association with the AWB) by:-

- a) Reviewing all teaching and research protocols involving protected live animals to ensure that these operate to the highest ethical standards.
- b) Promoting the development and uptake of appropriate alternatives to the use of live animals in teaching and research at UCD.
- c) Ensuring  that  the  appropriate  minimum  number  of  animals  required  for  teaching  or  valid research purposes are used in every instance.
- d) Promoting the development and uptake of refinements in techniques and ensuring that these improvements are incorporated into day-to-day practice.
- e) Promoting awareness of ethical principles and of animal welfare issues.
- f) Assisting members of the UCD Community in achieving best practice in the care and use of animals.
- g) Issuing codes of practice around the use of animals in research.
- h) Assisting the University in the formulation of policies on the use of animals in research and teaching.

## 6.2 Members of the UCD Community

- 6.2.1 Members  of  the  UCD  Community  shall  adhere  to  the  responsibilities  outlined  in  the  UCD Research Ethics Policy.
- 6.2.2 In  addition  to  ensuring  legal  compliance,  all  members  of  the  UCD  Community  carrying  out research or teaching involving protected live animals (whether on UCD premises or elsewhere) must do so in accordance with this policy and the codes of practice that have been approved by the AREC.
- 6.2.3 It  is  university policy that all teaching and research activity involving the use of animals that come under S.I. 543 of 2012 (or developing embryonic forms thereof) must have prior ethical approval (or prior exemption from full review) from the AREC -this includes any activity that involves live animals, including external collaborations where animals are used and where there is significant UCD involvement.
- 6.2.4 In the interests of good governance, UCD requires that the Project Manager, signatory on a Project  Authorisation  application  to  the  HPRA,  be  an  established  Principal  Investigator  for research  applications  or  a  module  coordinator  /  Head  of  School  nominee  for  teaching applications.
- 6.2.5 The  AREC  has  the  right  to  revoke,  suspend  or  modify  an  approval  at  any  time  and  with immediate effect. In the case of serious misconduct by a member of the UCD Community, their right to use animals in UCD may be reviewed, and possibly revoked, by the AREC or by the Compliance Committee.
