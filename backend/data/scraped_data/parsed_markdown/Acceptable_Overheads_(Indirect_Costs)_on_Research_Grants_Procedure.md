## Procedure on Acceptable Overheads (Indirect Costs) on Research Grants

Policy owner

## 1. Purpose

The costs of carrying out externally funded research may be separated into direct costs and indirect costs/overheads, as defined below. While direct costs are usually readily identifiable, and simple to include in a proposal budget, the amount of indirect costs/overheads that can be charged depends on a number of factors. This procedure sets out a clear structure to calculate the correct amount of indirect costs/overheads which must be included in all research proposal budgets.

Furthermore,  in  accordance  with  the  University's  Funded  Research  Activity  Policy  and  the  EU Commission's Framework on State Aid in Research &amp; Development &amp; Innovation 2014/163 (the 'RDI Framework'), contract research provided by the University should be charged at market price and any research collaborations with industry must meet the conditions of 'effective collaboration' as set out in the RDI Framework. In order to determine market price for the purposes of contract research, and in order to establish the University's contribution to a project for the purposes of meeting the conditions of 'effective collaboration', all indirect costs/overheads relating to the research need to be included in the project budget.

| Direct Costs               | Direct costs are those that can be identified accurately with a specific research project. Examples are the salaries of staff employed specifically to carry out the research work, and the materials and equipment purchased for the project. If the project requires the building or renting of new infrastructure, or if existing infrastructure needs to be modified, this is a direct cost. 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Indirect costs / Overheads | Indirect costs are those incurred in the course of a research project but which cannot be attributed specifically or exclusively to the project. Examples of such indirect costs are space, light, heat, maintenance, library services and computer services. Other examples are the indirect administrative support required to run the project, including recruiting staff, professional indemnity insurance, legal costs of generating and negotiating funding, collaborative and Intellectual Property (IP) agreements, procurement costs of purchasing equipment and materials and financial reporting. Indirect costs are also commonly known as overheads. |
| Research Funds             | Funding received from a third party governed by the terms of a Grant Agreement or Contract signed by all parties. This may be by way of State Agencies, Industry parties, or not for profit organisations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Effective Collaboration      | Collaboration between at least two independent parties to exchange knowledge or technology, or to achieve a common objective based on the division of labour where the parties jointly define the scope of the collaborative project, contribute to its implementation and share its risks, as well as its results. One or several parties may bear the full costs of the project and thus relieve other parties of its financial risks. Contract research and provision of research services are not considered forms of collaboration.

## 3. Scope

The policy applies to all income generated by research funded activity undertaken by the University and includes each of the stakeholders involved in the preparation, negotiating, registering and post award management of the funds.

## 4. Principles

Every effort should be made to maximise the external funding of indirect costs/overheads on research grants in accordance with funding agency/sponsor terms and conditions. Where engaging solely with an industry party, indirect costs/overheads in accordance with the guidance below must be included.

It is compulsory that Principal Investigators (PI) send their research proposal budgets for review to the Pre-Award Research  Accountant  in  UCD  Research  &amp;  Innovation,  prior  to  submission  to  a  funding agency/sponsor. The exception to this rule is where budgets are effectively pre-defined, e.g. Marie Curie Fellowship awards.

Indirect costs/overheads are awarded to the Institution and, in accordance with funding agency/sponsor's terms and conditions, must be used to  support the institutional infrastructure and indirect costs/overheads associated with running the project

## Indirect costs/overhead rates to be included in research proposal budgets:

- (1)  National State Funding Agency/Sponsor - Most national state funding agencies/sponsors allow for  indirect  costs/overheads  in  line  with  the  HEA  /  Forfas  Report  of  the  Group  on  Research Overheads, July 2003. This report recommends:
- An  overhead  rate  to  be  applied  to  modified  total  direct  costs  (i.e.  direct  costs  less equipment).
- A standard overhead rate of 30% for laboratory based research (SET).
- A standard overhead rate of 25% for desk based research (HSS).
- (2)  Non-Standard Funding Agency/Sponsor - Where a non-standard funding agency/sponsor has terms and conditions attached to a particular call for proposals, the PI will include the maximum allowable  charge  for  indirect  costs/overheads  when  preparing  the  budget  for  their  proposal,  in accordance with those terms and conditions.
- (3)  No  Terms  and Conditions - Where there are no available terms and conditions for research funding provided by a funding agency/sponsor, then the University will follow the guidance provided in the Irish Universities Association 2015 report 'Strategy for Research and Innovation (SSTI II) IUA Response to Consultation'. The report considered the following with regard to overhead rates within the sector.

'The indications are that the overhead rate required for full economic cost recovery of university research is of the order of 65% when academic staff costs are included or 50% when they are excluded. Currently, the overhead rate paid by the main research funder is 30% excluding academic staff costs and some funders pay less.…. This is a critical issue which needs to be addressed either through  an  overhead  rate  that  more  accurately  reflects  full  economic  costs  or  through  the establishment of a dedicated budget line for equipment and facilities maintenance.'

The University's opening position with regard to indirect costs/overheads sought must therefore be to seek a rate of 65% 2 . Subject to UCD retaining greater ownership of intellectual property (IP), the

2  In the US, universities negotiate individual rates with government authorities and these rates can range from 20% to 85%.

University  may,  however,  negotiate  a  lower  rate,  provided  that  the  value  of  the  indirect costs/overheads subsidised by the University  are reflected in the value of the IP rights retained by the University, i.e. that the research constitutes 'effective collaboration'. The opening position is that the University requires 65% indirect costs/overheads and any deviation from that must be negotiated and documented. The following table indicates the thresholds for different sources of funding below which the rate of indirect costs/overheads should not fall.

A waiver of indirect costs/overheads will not be permitted, save for circumstances where a funding agency/sponsor  is  a  charity  or  not  for  profit  organisation  and  is  funding  research  for  the public/common good, the results of the research are widely disseminated and provided that the value of the indirect costs/overheads subsidised by the University are reflected in the value of the IP rights retained by the University.

Exceptional cases may be brought to the President and VPRII for consideration provided (i) full costs, including indirect costs, have been calculated; (ii) UCD's contribution is defined within the overall cost; and (iii) the overall return to UCD, including the value of the IP rights for UCD under the research contract, is such as to ensure that UCD's contribution to the project is reflected in the economic return to UCD.  All costings and projected returns must be documented and submitted for consideration.

In addition to indirect costs/overheads, research proposal budgets must also include non-research funded staff time where eligible (see Procedure for costing staff time into research proposals). This is particularly applicable to work funded by industry, charities and not for profit organisations. This is to avoid a situation whereby UCD does not charge in full for the costs of a given project.

| Principal Investigator (PI) (Academic applying for research funding or negotiating contract research). | The PI must include indirect costs/overhead costs in the research proposal budget. The applicable rate can be determined by reference to Table 1 in section 4 above. Where there is doubt, the applicant should consult with the Pre-Award Accountant in UCD Research & Innovation. The PI must submit all research proposal budgets to the Pre-Award Accountant for budgetary review, in advance of submission to the funding agency/sponsor. Where a research proposal budget has not been passed to the Pre-Award Accountant for pre-approval and indirect costs/overheads have not been included, the Grant Registration team and Research Finance Offices will request the PI to amend the budget within the funds provided, in order to include an allocation for indirect costs/overheads. If this is not achievable, then the Grant Registration team reserve the right to: (i) unilaterally reduce budget headings to allow for indirect costs/overheads or (ii) not to progress the project to contract stage. |

The team will not commence the review process if there is an indication that indirect costs/overheads have not been correctly dealt with in the research proposal budget.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Other Research Performing Organisations (RPO's)      | Certain awards involve partnership arrangements with other universities within the state. These are typically large collaborative awards and may require involvement of industry parties. The indirect cost/overhead rate to be charged by each of the RPO's to the industry party must be the same. Agreement at senior management level (e.g. VP Research level or delegated authority) should be agreed in advance of any proposal, or alternatively, if no agreement can be reached, then the default rate as recommended by the HEA/Forfas (2003) report should be used. The Pre-Award Accountant should ensure this, as part of the initial budget review at proposal stage. |
