## Student Appeals Procedure

## 1. Introduction

The University is committed to providing students with the right to appeal, on permitted grounds, against University decisions relating to their assessment, progression or standing within the University. The purpose of the Student Appeals Procedure is to ensure that decisions affecting students are made in accordance with relevant procedures and that circumstances impacting students' performance or capacity to study are considered in a fair and consistent way.

The  Student  Appeals  Procedure  is  evidence  based.  Supporting  evidence  must  be  submitted  to substantiate all appeals. The procedure applies to all registered students and graduands. Appeals relating to Student (Garda) Vetting and Risk Assessment decisions from appellants who have accepted an offer of a place from the University will also be processed using this procedure.

This procedure should be read in conjunction with related policies, regulations and codes. Please see section 10. Students should read accompanying  Student  Guidelines before submitting an appeal. For assessment appeals, please also see Assessment Appeals Policy.
