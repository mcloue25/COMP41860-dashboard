## Resignation Policy

Policy owner :

## 1. Purpose

This policy provides an outline of the principles which underpin the resignation process in UCD and highlights the roles and responsibilities of all involved.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees of UCD (both permanent and fixed term).

If an employee is leaving one position to move to another position within UCD, they are not considered to be resigning from UCD's employment. Therefore, a resignation letter is not necessary.

## 3. Principles

The following steps should be followed by Employees and Heads of Schools/Units in the event of a resignation scenario.

- 3.1 All UCD Employees wishing to tender their resignation must do so in writing by submitting a 'letter of resignation' to their Manager on the day they verbally give notice. Notice will not be deemed to have commenced until such time as it is offered in writing, as per the terms of UCD's Contract of Employment.
- 3.2 Following consultation with the Manager, the Head of School/Unit will in turn confirm acceptance of an employee's resignation by completing UCD Human Resources' 'Employee Resignation Notification Form'. This must be forwarded to hrhelpdesk@ucd.ie within a week of the resignation being tendered, along with the original employee resignation letter (or a scanned copy).
- 3.3 The Head of School/Unit is responsible for confirming an employee's last day of work, as well as, any agreements they have made in regards to payment in lieu of annual leave not taken before this date. The accepted Notice period and last day of work must comply with UCD's Contract of Employment.
- 3.4 All former employees will be contacted within 6 weeks of the month end of their leave date by the Pensions Office regarding their Pension Options; however please refer to UCD HR Pensions web page for further information in the meantime.
- 3.5 Employees will carry out their normal tasks and duties as set out in their job description during the notice period
- 3.6 Employees must return any University property, e.g. Laptop, keys, phone, staff ID card etc. in their possession to their Head of School/Unit on their last day of work
- 3.7 The Employee or Head of School/Unit should contact hrhelpdesk@ucd.ie if any assistance is required

UCD Employees should follow the checklist below when composing a letter of resignation. It is important that all the information outlined in these points is communicated clearly and that resignations be submitted in the first instance to a Heads of School or Unit. The Head of School / Unit will confirm to UCD Human Resources acceptance of the details in the resignation letter, and communicate any details that are likely to impact on the employees' final salary payment. i.e. possible payment in lieu of holidays not taken.

## Check-list:

- Resignation letter is addressed to the current Head of School / Unit.
- Important dates (i.e. date of notification and proposed final day of work) are detailed clearly and are in accordance with UCD's contractual notice period.
- Any remaining holiday entitlements (number of days due, if any) is documented along with any intention to request leave during the notice period*.
* Where not operationally viable to take leave, payment will be made in lieu of any holiday entitlement remaining upon completion of the notice period.

## NOTE: Resignations are never made directly to UCD Human Resources.
