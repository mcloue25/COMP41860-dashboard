## UCD Student Fitness to Practise Policy and Procedures

Policy Owner:

Student Engagement, Conduct, Complaints and Appeals

Approval date and body:

16 April 2020, Academic Council Executive Committee

## 1. Purpose

- 1.1  The University's expectations regarding student conduct and behaviour are articulated in the UCD Student  Code.  Some  programmes  that  lead  to  a  professional  qualification  and  /  or  licence  to practice often require students to undertake practical training that entails working in a professional environment with patients, animals, other service users. The University has a duty to ensure that a student is fit to practise while undertaking education and training during their programme of study.
- 1.2 This  policy  sets  out  how  the  University  may  respond  to  instances  where  a  concern  is  raised regarding a student's fitness to practise and the type of action that may be taken to support the student and manage the matter.
- 1.3  This policy is designed to provide guidance about, and to set out procedures for, identifying and supporting students about whom there are student fitness to practise concerns; and for determining whether a student is fit to practise.
- 1.4 The objectives of this policy are to:
- a) Protect  the  public,  patients,  animals,  students,  faculty,  staff  placement  providers  and  the University;
- b) instill  in  students  the  qualities  and  competences  required  for  professional  practise  and  to support and guide students who experience issues that may affect their ability to practise;
- c) Identify and support students whose behaviour, capacity, welfare or wellbeing are of concern to themselves or others, or whose behaviour or actions are impacting adversely on, or pose a risk to, the learning, working, or living experiences of themselves or others;
- d) Provide  a  suitable  framework  for  the  effective,  consistent  and  timely  identification  and management of student fitness to practise issues that may arise, either prior to or during a student's programme of study;
- e) Treat concerns regarding student fitness to practise seriously and as quickly as possible.

## 2. Definitions

## 2.1 Student Fitness to Practise

The  health  and  safety  of  the  public,  patients,  animals,  service  users,  staff  and  students  is paramount.  Student fitness to practise means having the skills, knowledge, health and character necessary  to  undertake  and  complete  a  programme  with  professional  practice,  experiential learning or clinical work safely and effectively, fulfilling their responsibilities within their scope of practice in their chosen field in a manner that meets professional and ethical standards.

Examples of areas of concern or circumstances that might render a student unfit to practice include, but are not limited to: substance misuse; aggressive, violent or threatening behavior; persistent  inappropriate  attitude  or  behavior;  failure  to  accept  and  follow  educational  advice, failure to follow health and safety requirements or the regulations; impaired judgement; lack of competence; having health concerns and lack of insight or management of these; failure to seek medical  treatment  or  other  support;  refusal  to  follow  medical  advice  or  care  plans  including monitoring and reviews, in relation to maintaining fitness to practice; failure to recognise limits and abilities or lack of insight into health concerns.

Fitness to practise issues can occur at any stage during a student's time at University. The role of the policy is to establish a university-wide approach for dealing with such issues and facilitate Programmes and  Schools  in  providing  students  experiencing  difficulties  with  the  appropriate supports and opportunities to remedy any problems that they experience. It is important to note that  fitness  to  practise  issues  can  arise  and  be  satisfactorily  dealt  with  during  a  student's programme of study and outcomes of a formal fitness to practise procedures reflect a judgement on a particular issue, at a particular moment in time, and is not necessarily intended to be a judgement about a student's fitness to practise in the future.

## 2.2 Student Fitness to Practise and Health

In this context of this policy ill health means physical or mental health conditions that impair a student's ability to practise without supervision. Good health means that a person is capable of safe and effective practice without supervision. It does not mean the absence of any disability or health condition.

## 2.3 Programme Fitness to Practise Statement

Programmes' Fitness to Practise Statements are published by relevant programmes to provide clear  information  to  students  about  the  specific  standards  of  behaviour  and  professionalism required  in  the  context  of  their  programme  area.  The  new  or  revised  statements  must  be endorsed by a local governing board and submitted to ACCSCC for approval before they become operational.

ACCSCC will review and approve the proposed new Student Fitness to Practise Statements and revisions to the existing statements, and will maintain a register of programmes subject to Student Fitness to Practise Policy.

## 2.4 Governing Board

All  programmes  in  the  University  are  overseen  by  a  Programme  Board,  Board  of  Studies, Graduate Research Board, or Joint Academic Programme Board (all hereafter referred to as a Governing Board), which is responsible for monitoring the overall performance and progression of students registered to its programmes and ensuring their academic welfare.

## 2.5 Level 1

Level 1 refers to the procedures for an initial response and support at local level. See section 6 for Level 1 procedures.

## 2.6 Level 2

Level  2  refers  to  the  procedures  for  a  Governing  Board  review.  See  section  7  for  Level  2 procedures.

## 2.7 Return to study

Return  to  study  in  the  context  of  this  policy  refers  to  the  return  of  students  who  have  been suspended or directed to take a leave of absence from a programme under the Student Fitness to Practise Policy.

## 3. Scope

- 3.1 This policy applies to all students registered to programmes that are subject to the University Student Fitness to Practise Policy and to former students seeking to return to study who have previously  been  suspended,  withdrawn,  or  excluded  from  programmes  under  this  policy.. Successful  applicants  to  relevant  programmes  should  be  made  aware  of  the  UCD  Student Fitness  to  Practise  Policy  along  with  any  other  conditions  of  registration  such  as  healthcare screening  and  Student  (Garda)  Vetting.  Student  fitness  to  practise  issues  may  arise  at  both undergraduate  and  graduate  levels  of  study  on  programmes  that  may  lead  to  professional

qualifications.

- 3.2 This policy will, where relevant, be read in conjunction with the UCD Student Code, Student (Garda) Vetting and Infectious Diseases and General Health Screening procedures and relevant programme regulations or guidelines, as students on programmes subject to the Student Fitness to Practise Policy may also be subject to these additional conditions of registration, and noncompliance may have implications for their fitness to practice as a student.
- 3.3 At any stage of these procedures a case may be referred to be considered under an alternative University policy or procedure as appropriate. The Chair of the Governing Board shall decide which policy should have priority or be the most appropriate in the circumstances. The Chair of the Governing Board may suspend a policy or procedure, pending the outcome of another policy or procedure.
- 3.4 Students,  undertaking  placements as  part  of  their  programme,  may  also  be  subject  to  the placement  provider's  regulations,  and  procedures  of  the  placement  provider.  Placement providers  may,  using  their  own  procedures  independent  of  any  policy  implemented  by  the University, seek to suspend or terminate placements where it is believed the safety of the public, patients, animals, service users, students, faculty, staff or the public is deemed to be at risk. At any stage of these procedures, the continuation of a placement is subject to the agreement of the placement provider.

## 4. Principles

- 4.1 This policy should be interpreted in a manner that welcomes diversity, respects the dignity of all persons involved, promotes equal opportunities for students to develop their full potential, and ensures  a  positive  student  experience,  and  that  ensures  a  fair,  clear,  consistent  and  timely approach to dealing with student fitness to practise matters.
- 4.2 Student fitness to practise issues that arise should be discussed early and addressed locally between students and relevant staff (including as relevant supervisors and/or placement hosts) with  the  student  receiving  advice  on  how  best  to  improve  conduct  and  competence  so  that student fitness to practise issues do not arise again.
- 4.3 In implementing this policy, staff will consider what support may be offered to students both from within the University and externally. Students will be provided with information on the range of supports available and encouraged to seek support.
- 4.4 Programmes will promote student understanding of the importance of professional standards and an awareness of the provisions of the UCD Student Fitness to Practise Policy.
- 4.5 Determination as to what constitutes failure to meet fitness to practise requirements in specific programmes must be clearly articulated, documented and well communicated to the student as it is a breach of these stated criteria that will constitute the grounds on which fitness to practise procedures will be followed.
- 4.6 The processes under all levels of this policy will be undertaken in a transparent manner, and the student will  normally  be  informed  of  the  identity  and  capacity  of  any  persons  with  whom  the University consults, including third parties, such as health professionals.
- 4.7 Should a student be unable or unwilling to participate at any level of this policy or to attend a meeting, the University may nonetheless follow this policy where it is reasonable to do so.  The University may deal with issues on the basis of written reports and/or statements in the absence of the student. In addition, the University may consider any request from a student to proceed with a meeting in their absence on the basis of written reports and/or a written statement from the student.
- 4.8 Where an issue arises in relation to a student who is known to have a disability, and where the disability is relevant to the issue, then in the first instance consideration shall be given to the level and types of support put in place for the student in conjunction with UCD Access and Lifelong Learning. In consultation with the student, reasonable accommodation suitable to the needs of the student will be made available where practicable for students with disabilities. However, on programmes with a  Student Fitness to Practise  statement,  students  must  have  the  ability  to demonstrate core competencies, with appropriate reasonable accommodations in place where

necessary. Where additional support is necessary, it must be practicable within the current sphere of professional practice. Some students may be unable to complete elements of the programme required for professional registration for reason of health or physical ability.

- 4.9 All matters raised under this policy will be handled sensitively and confidentiality will be observed as far as possible.
- 4.10 A student may be accompanied at meetings provided for in this policy by a support person of their choice.
- 4.11 Students registered to programmes subject to the Student Fitness to Practise Policy are required to sign or electronically indicate consent to a Student Fitness to Practise statement at the start of each academic year.
- 4.12 The standard of proof applied at every stage of this Policy is the balance of probabilities.

## 6. Level 1: Procedure for Initial Response and Support at Local Level

- 6.1 In most cases student fitness to practise concerns can be addressed and resolved locally. For minor infringements, the existing practice of placement supervisors discussing their concerns directly with the student and with the University to agree steps to remedy the situation will usually be sufficient.  Serious or persistent student fitness to practise concerns are likely to warrant the initiation of formal procedures.
- 6.2 Initial  response and support may be appropriate where there are emerging concerns about a student's fitness to practise. Initial response and support comprise action or actions that aim to support students and to resolve the emerging concerns locally, at module, school or programme level, within the University, or in host institutions for placements, under this initial procedure.
- 6.3 While it is possible that individual faculty or staff 2  will have previously made efforts to support and advise  the  student,  the  Level  1  procedure  is  initiated  by  one  of  the  following:  placement supervisor,  programme  coordinator/director,  or  the  head  of  the  relevant  academic  unit  at  or following a meeting with the student.  If the student does not attend a meeting the procedure may be initiated in their absence and the student will be so informed.
- 6.4 An initial response may include a recommendation that the student be provided with, and/or be encouraged to avail of, supports. The following is an indicative, but non-exhaustive, list of potential supports:
- a) Appropriate academic advice (e.g. supervisor, academic adviser, stage coordinator)
- b) Referral to the Extenuating Circumstances Policy
- c) Referral to Leave of Absence Policy
- d) Life Skills Collection or UCD Books on Prescription Scheme
- e) College/School Offices
- f) UCD Access and Lifelong Learning
- g) UCD Chaplaincy
- h) UCD Student Advisers
- i) UCD Student Counselling Service
- j) UCD Student Health Service
- k) UCD Students' Union Welfare Officer

2 For example academic staff, student adviser, College/School Office staff or staff associated with, or located in, the student placement environment

- 6.5 The purpose of the initial response and support is to resolve any concerns by reaching agreement with the student (and, if relevant, the placement host) on recommended actions. The student (and, if relevant, the placement host) shall be notified in writing of agreed actions, timeframes or review periods (i.e. the action plan).
- 6.6 In some circumstances, supportive actions may include a recommendation that a student takes a leave of absence, an exit award if available, or voluntarily withdraw from the programme in the interests of their safety, health and/or wellbeing, and/or that of others.
- 6.7 If the concern is not resolved or persists, the case should be referred to the Governing Board for the  student's  programme  (Level  2),  along  with  supporting  documentation  (e.g.  the  written notification of supports and interventions, and recommended actions and agreed timeframes or review periods).
- 6.8 If the concern arises immediately prior to or during a placement, the placement may be delayed or deferred while the concerns are being addressed.

## 7. Level 2: Procedures for Governing Board Review

- 7.1 The Chair of the Governing Board shall decide if a case review should take place.
- 7.1.1  The  Chair  may  seek  further  information  or  professional  advice  before  considering  any further action.  This may include medical and/or psychological assessment, which shall not be at the expense of the student. The assessment shall be undertaken by an appropriately qualified person nominated by the Chair and currently working in the area, without a conflict of interest, and unrelated to and independent of the student.
- 7.1.2  If  the  Chair  decides  a  case  review  should  take  place,  on  receipt  of  all  documentation relevant  to  the  case,  including  relevant  information  from  a  placement  host,  the  Chair convenes  a  Student  Fitness  to  Practise  Subcommittee  (hereafter  the  Subcommittee), which acts with full delegated authority of the Governing Board.  It conducts a case review to  consider  reported  student  fitness  to  practise  concerns  and  the  initial  response  and support provided at Level 1.
- 7.1.3 The student shall be informed in writing that the Level 2 procedure has been initiated and that the Subcommittee has been convened. The student should be invited to and given a minimum of ten working days' notice of the date of the meeting.  The student may choose to waive the notice period if the Subcommittee can convene a meeting in advance of the notice period.
- 7.1.4  The  student  will  be  asked  to  confirm  their  availability  to  attend  the  meeting.  Where  a student does not attend a meeting the committee may choose to proceed in their absence. Where a student intends to be accompanied to the meeting by support person of their choice,  they  should  provide  the  Subcommittee  with  the  name  and  capacity  of  the accompanying person in advance of the meeting.
- 7.1.5  A copy of any relevant documentation that has been supplied in respect of the case will be provided to the student in advance of the meeting. The student shall be invited to make their own written submission in advance of the meeting.

## 7.2 Composition of the Student Fitness to Practise Subcommittee

- 7.2.1  The Subcommittee shall comprise three voting members: a Chairperson (or their delegate as per section 5.1c), one member of the Governing Board from the student's professional discipline,  and  another  member  of  the  Governing  Board,  who  is  ideally  not  from  the student's professional discipline (for the purposes of fairness and cross-learning).
- 7.2.2  A member of staff may be appointed as a non-voting secretary of the Subcommittee.
- 7.2.3  The  Subcommittee  may  co-opt  additional  members  to  provide  required  expertise  or specific representation and advice to the Subcommittee. The co-option of members will be on a case-by-case basis and requires the agreement of the Chair of the Governing Board. Co-opted members will act in a strictly advisory capacity and shall be non-voting.
- 7.2.4  The Subcommittee for the case review should be kept as small as possible.

## 7.3 Procedures of the Subcommittee meeting

- 7.3.1  The  Subcommittee  may  seek  attendance  of  other  relevant  parties  to  provide  verbal evidence and accounts of incidents or behavior that have called into question the student's fitness to practise.
- 7.3.2  At the meeting, the Chair should outline the procedures of the meeting, setting out the different possible outcomes available to the Subcommittee.
- 7.3.3  Members of the Subcommittee may ask the student questions relating to the concerns over their fitness to practise as a student.
- 7.3.4  The student should be given the opportunity to respond to any concerns raised and may make any relevant contribution to the meeting.
- 7.3.5  The Subcommittee shall determine whether they consider that the student is fit to practise (see section 2.1 and 2.2).

- b)  Direct that the student be allowed to continue, subject to review under certain specified conditions,  such  as  careful  mentoring  by  an  appropriately  experienced  member  of faculty at the grade of Associate Professor or above, and/or by a member of staff of the placement host;
- c)  Direct that a student who has failed to comply with any requirement to be assessed is assessed by an appropriate qualified person and suspended, without prejudice, until they are certified as fit to practise as a student by the person recommended by the University  in  section  7.1.1,  without  a  conflict  of  interest  and  unrelated  to  and independent of the student;
- d)  Direct that a student be suspended, from attending UCD or a placement with immediate effect for a specified period, with or without conditions.
- e)  Direct that the student be required to undertake a second attempt for certain elements of the programme of study without academic penalty;
