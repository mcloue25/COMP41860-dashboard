## 1. Purpose

University College Dublin (UCD) recognises the benefits that pet ownership can bring and also the crucial functions carried out by highly trained Service Dogs. The University welcomes the presence of responsible cat and dog owners and their animals on University Grounds, subject to  the  conditions  specified  in  section  4.2  of  this  policy,  and  is  committed  to  reasonably accommodating the needs of Service Dog users. In return the University asks that all animal owners take steps to ensure that their cats and dogs not pose a risk to any persons, do not constitute a nuisance and are kept under control at all times.

Notwithstanding  welcoming  responsible  pet  owners  and  a  commitment  to  the  reasonable accommodation of Service Dog users, it is acknowledged that the presence of animals within University Premises and on University Grounds may give rise to:

1. Delayed evacuation in an emergency situation
2. Animal aggression or boisterous behaviour towards persons or other animals
3. Potential allergy and zoonotic issues
4. Distress in persons who suffer from zoophobia
5. Slips and falls caused by animals
6. Animal excreta in working and welfare environments
7. Damage to University property

Consequently, this policy has been developed to ensure the safety and comfort of the wider University  community  and  campus  users  with  respect  to  the  presence  of  animals  within University Premises and on University Grounds.

## 2. Definitions

## 2.1 Service Dog

A Service Dog is a highly trained dog that has been specifically trained to assist a person with a disability. A Service Dog is primarily a working animal.

For an animal to be recognised as a Service Dog it must be fully trained and registered with one of the following or a recognised international equivalent:

1. Irish Guide Dogs For The Blind
2. Dogs For The Disabled (Cork)
3. Autism Assistance Dogs Ireland
4. Canine Partners (UK)
5. Dog A.I.D. (UK)
6. Guide Dogs UK
7. Hearing Dogs For Deaf People (UK)
8. Medical Detection Dogs (UK)
9. Support Dogs (UK)
10. International Guide Dog Federation

The University will make the final decision as to whether an animal is a Service Dog or not and will in exceptional cases review applications for recognition as same from dog owners where the  owners  can  show  a  level  of  certified  training  from,  in  the  opinion  of  the  University,  a recognised reputable organisation(s) which is comparable to that offered by the entities listed above.

## 2.2 Emotional Support Animal / Comfort Animal

An animal used by a person to provide comfort or emotional support, but which does not meet the  criteria  to  be  classified  as  a  Service  Dog.  The  terms  'emotional  support  animal'  and 'comfort' animal are not recognised under current Irish legislation.

## 2.3 Veterinary Support Animals

Animals owned by University staff or students and which are utilised by the UCD Veterinary Hospital for teaching purposes, blood donation or similar, as approved by the UCD Veterinary Hospital  Clinical  Director  and  /  or  the  Dean  and  Head  of  the  UCD  School  of  Veterinary Medicine or their nominee(s).

## 2.4 Pet

An animal kept by a person for companionship or pleasure.

## 2.5 University Grounds

Open areas on any University managed site outside of University Premises.

## 2.6 University Premises

Any building, vehicle, structure or residence owned or managed by the University.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to all University staff and students and to all visitors to every University owned, operated or managed site or premises except for the exclusions listed below.

The policy does not apply to:

1. Animals associated with specific once off events or activities, subject to the event or activity being approved in advance by Campus Services and the Safety Insurance Operational Risk and Compliance (SIRC) Office, at which time the University's requirements regarding the use of animals at the event will be set out. At a minimum the University will require details of the animal species involved, the duration of any handling by non-owners, the degree of habituation in the animal(s) to such handling, arrangements for penning and supervision when on site, and details of how animal welfare is ensured by the owners both when 'at home' and when in UCD. Such events may be subject to prior review and on the ground inspections by specialist Animal Welfare experts from UCD.

2. Animals attending the UCD Veterinary Hospital for clinical reasons or treatment (for the duration of that purpose only)
3. Animals whose usage falls under the university's policy on the Use of Animals for Research and Teaching, save for Veterinary Support Animals
4. Static fish tanks holding fish only
5. Animals on Lyons Farm

## 4. Principles

## 4.1 Pets, Comfort Animals and Emotional Support Animals

The  bringing  of  pets,  comfort  animals  or  emotional  support  animals  into  any  University premises by students, staff members or visitors to the University is prohibited, as to allow such access  to  University  premises  could  give  rise  to  disorderly  conduct  and  interference  with University activities and cause disruption to the learning experience.

## 4.2 Dogs and Cats on University Grounds

Dogs and cats (referred to as animals in this section) may be brought onto University Grounds, subject to adherence to the following:

1. The animal must be kept under the control of a responsible adult at all times.
2. All solid animal waste matter must be cleaned up by the owner or person responsible for the animal promptly. Persons in control of animals are expected to act responsibly in this matter and to carry their own waste bags and any other equipment as may be required to clean  up  after  their  animal.  There  are  bins  available  on  University  Grounds  for  waste disposal.
3. Animals  must  be  kept  under  control  so  as  to  ensure  the  safety  of  other  animals  and persons.  If  directed  by  Campus  Services  personnel  animal  owners  must  place  their animals on a lead.
4. Animals must not be allowed to make a nuisance of themselves or interfere with traffic, other animals or persons.
5. Aggressive or uncontrolled animals will not be tolerated on University grounds and owners of such animals will be directed to remove them from University grounds.
6. The animal must not be kept confined in a vehicle for an extended period. In the event that Campus Services staff are of the opinion that an animal kept in a car is in distress the Gardaí will be contacted and Campus Services staff may take any measures that they consider necessary to safeguard the animal.

7. If, in the opinion of Campus Services Personnel, a dog on University property is a specified breed under current Control Of Dogs Legislation, the owner will be directed to ensure that the animal is kept on a leash and muzzled at all times.
8. If  directed  by  Campus  Services  personnel  owners  must  remove  their  animal  from University grounds on demand.

Animal owners are reminded that the grounds of University College Dublin are private property and their presence on campus with their animal is at the discretion of the University. Access to University grounds for animals is not a right and the University may prohibit any animal from the grounds at any time.

## 4.2 Service Dogs

Service Dogs may be brought onto University Grounds subject to the animal and the owner adhering to the requirements placed upon non-Service Dogs visiting University Grounds which are detailed immediately above.

Service Dogs are also welcome in University buildings subject to owners ensuring:

1. That their animal wears an identifiable harness or a branded lead clearly stating that it is a working Service Dog.
2. That  they  carry  suitable  identification  to  prove  that  their  animal  is  a  Service  Dog  if requested for clarification.

The University recognises that Service Dogs are highly trained working animals who pose a minimal risk of causing disruption to University activities.

Members of the  wider  University  community  are  reminded  that  Service  Dogs  are  working animals and not pets and should not be disturbed when at work. In addition, a wide variety of dog breeds can be used as Service Dogs and no assumptions should be made about an animal's status based on its breed.

Students who utilise a Service Dog and who are considering attending University College Dublin must contact UCD Access &amp; Lifelong Learning prior to accepting their offer to discuss their  individual needs and to ensure that any necessary supports that they require can be made  fully  available  to  them  and  their  Service  Dog.  Students  who  wish  to  attend  UCD accompanied  by  their  Service  Dog  must  provide  satisfactory  evidence  of  a  disability  and details of their dog's training and registration (see Section 2.1 ab ove) and must not attend classes  or  University  facilities  with  their  dog  until  authorised  by  the  University  to  do  so. Prospective students who have any questions should contact UCD Access &amp; Lifelong Learning (http://www.ucd.ie/all/). UCD is committed to ensuring that students with disabilities have full and equal access to all facets of university life.

Staff who utilise Service Dogs are strongly advised to contact their line manager to discuss any reasonable accommodation provisions that may be required to facilitate their Service Dogs at work and to ensure that the necessary supports are in place for them and their Service Dogs.

## 4.4 Veterinary Support Animals

Veterinary  Support  Animals  which  are  owned  by  University  staff  and  students  provide  a valuable service within the UCD Veterinary Hospital / Veterinary Sciences Centre through their use in teaching and associated activities and also in the provision of blood donations.  The presence of such animals within the UCD Veterinary Hospital / Veterinary Sciences Centre is allowable subject to the following criteria being met:

1. Where applicable the use of the animal must be subject to ethical approval.
2. The welfare of the animal must be paramount at all times.
3. When not in active use the animal must be suitably accommodated.
4. Animals  must  only  be  brought  into  the  premises  when  their  use  in  veterinary  support activities is reasonably foreseeable for that day.
5. The UCD Veterinary Hospital will maintain a register of Veterinary Support Animals and all persons bringing such an animal into the UCD Veterinary Hospital / Veterinary Sciences Centre will be required to complete this register on a daily basis, detailing the foreseeable nature of the animals use on that day, how the animal will be accommodated, and how its welfare will be safeguarded. This register will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the UCD Veterinary Hospital Clinical Director and / or the Dean and Head of the UCD School of Veterinary Medicine or their nominee(s) who may direct that an animal be removed from

the premises if its use in an approved activity is not reasonably foreseeable for that day or if the animals welfare is deemed to be at risk.

It is noted that some clinicians who are 'on call' may be required to attend the hospital at very short  notice,  during  out  of  hours  periods  and  for  prolonged  periods  of  time,  and  these individuals, solely at the discretion of the UCD Veterinary Hospital Clinical Director and / or the Dean and Head of the UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, may utilise the UCD Veterinary Hospital / Veterinary Sciences Centre for the temporary housing of their animal for welfare purposes. Note that this usage must also be recorded in the aforementioned register.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

All members of the University community and visitors to the University are expected to adhere to the provisions of this policy. Persons bringing animals onto University Grounds and into University Premises are expected to act responsibly at all times as outlined in 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above.
