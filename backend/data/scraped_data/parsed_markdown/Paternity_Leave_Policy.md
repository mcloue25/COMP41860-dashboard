## Paternity Leave Policy

Policy owner: UCD HR

## 1. Purpose

Our University is committed to providing an inclusive and diverse environment in which all members of our community are valued and supported, both in the workplace and in their family life. Paternity leave was introduced under the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 and applies to adoptions/placements that take place on or after the 1 September 2016. This legislation expands on the current supports already in place in the University for carers, by enabling eligible employees to take time off from work around the birth or adoption of their child, or the child of their spouse or partner. This leave forms part of a suite of family-friendly initiatives available in the University and supports a more equitable sharing of parental caring duties. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that University employees are supported before, during and after their paternity leave.

## 2. Definitions

The term 'relevant parent', shall be understood to mean a person (other than the mother of the child) who is

insurance (PRSI). Paternity Benefit is paid for two weeks. Employees, who are eligible for this payment, are required to claim the same.

## 3. Scope

This Paternity Leave Policy applies to all UCD employees who are in receipt of a salary under a permanent contract, a contract of indefinite duration (CID), or a fixed-term contract as defined in the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003 and who are entitled to benefit under the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016.

Paternity leave is available to those employees who are deemed to be the relevant parent of a child. Only one person who is a relevant parent in relation to a child can be entitled to paternity leave in respect of that child. There is no qualifying period for entitlement to paternity leave. Employees employed under a fixed-term or a specified purpose contract of employment, are entitled to paternity leave during the period of the fixed term or specific purpose, as set out in their contract of employment. Any entitlement to leave and payment for same shall last only as long as the term of their contract of employment.

## 4. Principles

Paternity leave seeks to support those with parental caring responsibilities to balance their work and family life. It also encourages a more equitable sharing of parental responsibilities to allow for more equality of opportunity in the workplace. Our University fosters a culture that embraces equality, diversity and inclusion for all individuals in our community. As such, the principle of equality shall be applied in the interpretation of this policy to ensure that all University employees are supported and treated equally before, during and after their paternity leave.

Furthermore, an employee's absence from work while on Paternity Leave will count for all employment rights associated with their employment such as annual leave and seniority.

It is the policy of the University to maintain eligible employee's salaries, subject to certain deductions 1 , for the duration of paternity leave (two weeks). Any entitlement to leave and payment for same shall last only as long as the term of the employee's contract of employment.

## Breach of this Paternity Leave Policy

Paternity leave should be used for its intended purpose. Where the University has reasonable grounds for believing that an employee who is on paternity leave is not using the leave for the intended purpose, the leave can be terminated, and an investigation may be carried out. Disciplinary action may be taken against employees found to be contravening this policy and/or other related policies and procedures.
