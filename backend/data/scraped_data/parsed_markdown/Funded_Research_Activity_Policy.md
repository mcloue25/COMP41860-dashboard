Policy owner

## 1. Purpose

University College Dublin is committed to the promotion of an environment which maintains the highest standards of integrity in relation to its educational mission and research activity and fosters excellence in research and innovation for the benefit of society and the Irish economy.

This document provides a statement of policy on Funded Research Activity in UCD having regard to the Ethics in Public Office Acts, 1995, the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, the Universities Act, 1997,  the  EU  Commission's  Framework  on  State  Aid  in  Research  &amp;  Development  &amp;  Innovation 2014/163 (the 'RDI Framework') and the Statutes and policies of the University. Researchers must comply with  the  institutional  policies  of  the  University  when  undertaking  research,  educational  and administrative activity (i.e. HR, Finance, Health &amp; Safety, Procurement, Legal, Ethics and IP policies etc.). In particular, it is not the intention of the University that this policy should undermine academic freedom, as defined in the Universities Act, 1997, under Section 14.

| Direct Costs               | Direct costs are those that can be identified accurately with a specific research project. Examples are the salaries of staff employed specifically to carry out the research work, and the materials and equipment purchased for the project. If the project requires the building or renting of new infrastructure, or if existing infrastructure needs to be modified, this is a direct cost. 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Indirect Costs / Overheads | Indirect costs are those incurred in the course of a research project but which cannot be attributed specifically or exclusively to the project. Examples of such indirect costs are space, light, heat, maintenance, library services and computer services. Other examples are the indirect administrative support required to run the project, including recruiting staff, professional indemnity insurance, legal costs of generating and negotiating funding, collaborative and IP agreements, procurement costs of purchasing equipment and materials and financial reporting. Indirect costs are also commonly known as overheads. |
| Contract / Grant Agreement | An agreement, usually in writing, that is enforceable by law and specifies the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Contract Research          | Research undertaken on behalf of a third party where the third party specifies the terms of the research and owns the results of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Effective Collaboration | Collaboration between at least two independent parties to exchange knowledge or technology, or to achieve a common objective based on the division of labour where the parties jointly define the scope of the collaborative project, contribute to its implementation and share its risks, as well as its results. One or several parties may bear the full costs of the project and thus relieve other parties of its financial risks. Contract research and provision of research services are not considered forms of collaboration. For further details, see section 2.2.2 of the RDI Framework. |

## 3. Scope

This policy covers UCD faculty, staff and students and all those engaged in UCD research activity and sets out the University's expectations of faculty, staff and students conducting funded research.

## 4. Principles

The University funded research activity policy is underpinned by the following principles:

1. The University is accountable for managing the invested funds associated with research activity through  its  academic  units  and  academic  staff.  It  does  this  by  devolving  responsibility  of management of these funds to the academic  units  and the researchers  who  are  charged  with managing the programmatic and financial viability of the proposed research activity.
2. The  Schools/Units  and  Institutes  play  a  leadership  role  in  monitoring  and  supporting  funded research activity at local level.
3. The core support units, in partnership with the Colleges, Schools/Units and Institutes, support the research community within the resources available, at all stages of the research process.
4. Any legal, financial or other risk associated with funded research activity will be managed effectively with the support of the core support units and relevant School/Unit and/or Institute.
5. The  University  will  establish  clear  policies  and  procedures  which  cover  the  principles  of  good practice in research and will ensure that these policies and procedures complement and are in accordance with existing organisational policies.
6. Researchers must comply with the institutional policies of the University when undertaking research activity (e.g. HR, Finance, Health &amp; Safety, Procurement, Legal, Ethics and IP policies). Further, researchers must adhere to the terms and conditions of the funding agency/sponsor with regard to any award being made for funded research activity.

7. The funding of research can potentially fall within the scope of the European Union's rules on State Aid.  This  funded  research  activity  policy  seeks  to  follow  the  guidance  set  out  in  the  EU Commission's RDI Framework so that research funding received by the University falls outside of the definition of what might be considered to constitute State Aid. Accordingly, all contract research and  research  services  provided  by  the  University  should  be  charged  at  market  price  and  any research collaborations with industry must meet the conditions of 'effective collaboration' as set out in the RDI Framework.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

## 5a. Role of the Vice-President for Research, Innovation and Impact

1.   The Vice-President for Research, Innovation &amp; Impact or nominee, may, where appropriate, give authority for a departure from this Policy.
2.   The Vice-President for Research, Innovation &amp; Impact or nominee, may, where appropriate, require confirmation of compliance with this Policy.

## 5b. Research Proposal

1. All proposals must be sent to the Pre-Award Accountant in UCD Research and Innovation for review and compliance check.  The researcher must assess the full resource requirements and total costs of fulfilling the research activities being proposed, including the following:
- Proposal costings (including direct and indirect costs)
- Tax and legal considerations (including Value Added Tax (VAT))
- Human Resources (HR) considerations
- Infrastructure requirements
- Research Ethics
- Intellectual Property (IP)
- Health and Safety

The  Pre-Award  Accountant  in  UCD  Research  and  Innovation  can  support  the  total  costing  of proposals.

2. All eligible research costs directly associated with the research activity must be included as direct costs . The costing of salaries in a research proposal must take into consideration the Procedure for costing staff time into research proposals , the UCD Salary Policy for Post-doctoral Researchers and  Research  Assistants ,  as  well  as  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  proposed  funding agency/sponsor.
3. The maximum level of contribution towards the indirect costs (overheads) must be sought in addition  to  the  direct  costs.    The  Pre-Award  Accountant  in  UCD  Research  and  Innovation  can advise  on  the  Indirect  Costs  inclusion,  utilising  the  guidelines  outlined  in  the Procedure  on Acceptable Overheads (Indirect Costs) on Research Grants . All proposals must seek a contribution towards indirect costs, unless the funding agency/sponsor specifically excludes same.
4. All staff time must be included in the budget where eligible, in accordance with the Procedure for costing staff time into research proposals . This is particularly applicable to work funded by industry, charities and not-for-profit organisations.
5. The Head of School/Unit/Institute Director or nominee must be made aware of the total costs of delivering the proposed research activities , including any additional resource requirements, and the proposed level of funding being sought.
6. The research proposal must be approved by the Vice-President for Research, Innovation &amp; Impact or nominee before it is submitted to the funding agency/sponsor.

7. Applicants seeking external funding must be:
- A member of academic staff, permanent or with a contract that covers the period of the grant), or
- A researcher on a UCD contract, recognised by UCD as an independent researcher who will have an independent office and research space at the host research body, for which they will be fully responsible, for at least the duration of the grant, or
- A researcher who will be recognised by UCD upon receipt of the proposed grant as a researcher on a UCD contract as defined above. The applicant does not necessarily need to be employed by UCD at the time of proposal submission.
8. Postgraduate students are eligible to apply for research funding, where permitted by the funding agency/sponsor and where supported by the student's supervisor.
9. Postdoctoral  fellows  are  eligible  to  apply  for  research  grants  where  the  following  criteria  are satisfied:
- The postdoctoral fellow has an employment contract that spans the duration of the award, or the proposed grant will cover the salary of the postdoctoral researcher, who will be issued with an employment contract to last the full duration of the grant, should the proposal be successful,  subject  to  the  employment  policies  of  the  University  with  regard  to  the employment  of  research  staff  ( UCD  Employment  Contract  Management  Policy  Post Doctoral Research Staff (Humanities and Social Sciences) and UCD Employment Contract Management Policy Post Doctoral Research Staff (SET) ).
- If  the  proposed award does not cover the salary of the proposed grant holder, and the salary of the grant holder is being paid through a separate research grant, the terms and conditions of this grant must allow the grant holder to apply for further funding to carry out new research projects simultaneously.
- The postdoctoral management policy of the University is adhered to ( UCD Employment Contract  Management  Policy  Post  Doctoral  Research  Staff  (Humanities  and  Social Sciences )  and UCD Employment Contract Management Policy Post Doctoral Research Staff (SET) . This includes ensuring that the postdoctoral period in UCD of (normally) 4-6 years (Levels 1 and 2 inclusive) is taken into account before applying for any award.
10. The  prevailing  institutional  policies  relating  to  the  employment  of  research  staff  will  supersede funding agency/sponsor rules and the naming of an individual on a grant application should not be construed as a commitment to employ them ( UCD Recruitment and Selection Policy - Research Funded Staff )

## 5c. Registering a Research Grant

1. The  research  contract  /  grant  agreement  must  be  approved  (and  signed)  by  the  appropriate institutional authority 2  and the authorised officials for all parties, before any research account is set up.
2. Any  associated  research  agreement  (e.g.  Consortium  Agreement  (CA),  Materials  Transfer Agreement (MTA), sub-contract etc.) must be reviewed, approved and signed by all parties.
3. The researcher must read, understand and agree to comply with all terms set out in the contract/ grant agreement documentation associated with their research funding, including any terms and conditions in relation to research integrity, reporting, record keeping, data protection, confidentiality, publishing, intellectual property rights, ethics, anti-corruption and state aid. The researcher must also  engage  with  the  relevant  University  offices  in  reviewing  the  contract  documentation  for approval.

2  Awards must be authorised by the Bursar/Chief Financial Officer or nominee.

4. While all researchers and research students are encouraged to apply for research funding, as per the eligibility  set  out  by  the  individual  funding  agency/sponsor,  only  the  following  are  eligible  to register and manage research accounts on the UCD financial system:
- Members of the University's staff: Individuals who, at the time of signing the grant, are on the  University's  Core  HR/Payroll  System with a contract of employment that spans the duration of the research grant. This includes individuals who fulfil the following roles or their equivalent:
3. o Full Professor/ Professor/ Adjunct Professor/ Visiting Professor / Clinical Pathways Professors
4. o Associate Professor/ Assistant Professor
5. o Research-Active Retired Faculty 3
6. o Postdoctoral Fellow (PD)/ Research Fellow (RF) 4
7. o Research administrative and technical staff (these will be considered on a case by case basis).

Note: Research grants for postgraduate students will be registered in the name of their supervisor.

## 5d. Management of the Research Grant

1. Any change which is not provided for under the terms &amp; conditions of the grant must be approved by  the  funding  agency/sponsor,  Head  of  School/Unit  or  Institute  Director  (as  appropriate)  and central University authority (i.e. Vice President for Research, Innovation &amp; Impact/Bursar's Office or nominee). The following are examples of changes that may require approval:
- start/end dates
- budget transfers outside of range permitted under the contract/grant agreement
- purpose/intention of funding
- change in named researcher responsible for the grant
2. If there is insufficient funding provided by the funding agency/sponsor to cover any  PhD fees, then this will be dealt with according to the Procedure for Shortfall in Research funded PhD Fees
3. The research contract / grant agreement provides a written agreement to conduct research activity in return for approved funding and is made between the funding agency/sponsor and the University. This  agreement  remains  in  place  regardless  of  the  mobility  of  the  named  researcher  and  the approval of both parties must be obtained before any portion of the grant can be transferred from the University with the researcher.
4. If the named researcher's eligibility status changes before completion of the research project, the Head  of  School/Unit  or  Institute  Director  (as  appropriate)  must  agree  a  path  with  the  funding agency/sponsor to either continue the research, bring the current research activity to a close or move the grant to another institution.
5. The researcher must maintain and provide access to all supporting documentation necessary for compliance with the University's policies on Freedom of Information, Record and Data Management and  audit  requirements.  This  includes  all  records  of  expense  claims,  any  invoices  and  project reports.
6. The researcher must ensure that all reporting requirements to funding agencies/sponsors are met within  the  deadline  specified  by  these  agencies.  The  researcher  must  ensure  that  all  data,  or

3 UCD Policy on Engaging Research and Teaching-Active Retired Faculty gives further information

4 Where a PD/RF writes the proposal and is awarded the grant, they are entitled to register the award in their own name on the UCD Research Management System (RMS). For operational purposes, where a grant is to be held in  a  PD/RF  name,  it  may  initially  be  registered  in  the  Mentors  name,  and  then  subsequently  changed  to  be registered  in  the  name  of  the  PD/RF.  The  PD/RF  should  seek  advice  from  their  mentor  in  relation  to  grant management issues where they arise.

supporting records related to any information contained in reports, is available to the University throughout the course of the award and for a period after the end of the project, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the funding agency/sponsor.

7. Once  the  end  date  of  the  contract  has  been  reached,  Research  accounts  should  be  closed according to the Procedure for Closing Research Accounts .
