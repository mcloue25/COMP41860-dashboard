## APPENDIX 1

## 1. Purpose

Research Studies Panels are designed to enhance the supervisor-student relationship and to ensure the quality of the research student experience in the context of structured research degrees.

## 2. Composition of Research Studies Panel

- Principal supervisor
- Any co-supervisor(s) or external supervisor
- A number of advisers (at least two but normally no more than four)

Full regulations for the appointment of a Research Studies Panel are available in sections 7, 8 or 9 of the academic regulations (with some variations in composition for programmes referenced in sections 8 or 9 of regulations).

The Research Studies Panel must appoint a Chair independent of Principal/Co-Supervisors.

Members of the Research Studies Panel will not normally act on the Stage Transfer Assessment Panel of the student, unless prior approval obtained from the relevant Governing Board is obtained, and cannot act as an Internal examiner for that student.

## 3. Conduct of Business

The Research Studies Panel should meet at least once soon after the student begins their graduate research programme of study. The Research Studies Panel should meet to review progress on a regular basis, but at least twice in the first year and at least once a year thereafter.

The student or  another member of the RSP may convene a meeting of the panel at any stage (with appropriate notice to all concerned) if it is considered desirable or necessary to address any relevant issue that may arise.

After the introductory meeting, a student would typically organise future meetings. If it is noted that  a meeting(s) is/are overdue for a student then the supervisor or School should engage with the student on this matter.

A Research Studies Panel will conduct its business in accordance with relevant UCD policies and regulations, including the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy.

## 4. Terms of Reference

The responsibilities of a Research Studies Panel include monitoring the progress of the student through their graduate research studies, ensuring the quality of supervision, and providing advice, guidance and support to the student and supervisor. The key responsibilities of the Research Studies Panel are to:

- 4.1. Enhance the supervisor-student relationship by the provision of advice in accordance with the University's Policy for Supervision of Research Degree Students .
- 4.2. Ensure quality, rigour and equity of the supervision process.

## 5. Governance

- 5.1. The Research Studies Panel is, in all activities and decisions, subject to review by the Governing Board and the Academic Council or its relevant committee
