## Sexual Misconduct Policy

<!-- image -->

Policy owner Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion Approval date and body 11 May 2022, UMT

This policy document has been developed following desk-based research into best practice nationally  and  internationally,  extensive  internal  consultation  through  externally  facilitated focus  groups,  written  submissions  and  individual  meetings  and  external  consultation  with experts in the area of dignity and respect. The national framework, 'Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive: Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions, 2019',  which  outlines  a  framework  that  promotes  a  healthy  and  informed  understanding  of consent and relationship in higher education systems, has been closely followed in support of this policy. The Irish Universities Association, How to Respond to Alleged Staff or Student or University Related Sexual Misconduct 2020 has also informed the development of this policy.

This policy is one element of a broad framework to work towards a culture of dignity and respect at UCD to include but not limited to: targeted training for key roles, an ongoing University-wide awareness raising campaign and training, dedicated full-time and voluntary support roles and a range of supporting documentation such as visual aids.

We encourage you to come forward to seek support and assistance in relation to issues of sexual misconduct, so that we can work with you to resolve these issues. You can be assured that we will act sensitively and disclosures will be carefully and thoughtfully addressed through a process that is transparent and clearly communicated to all individuals involved. Issues of a sexual misconduct nature may potentially constitute a criminal offence. Employees or students can contact the Gardaí directly or through the Duty Manager in Estate Services who has access to a contact point in Donnybrook Garda Station at any time, day or night. The Duty manager can be contacted on Extension 716 7999.

All individuals involved in a sexual misconduct issue will be supported.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy and supplementary materials, including the Dignity and Respect Support and Guidance document and the Formal Investigation Procedures document, is to support the development of  a  working  and  learning  environment  in  which  sexual  misconduct  is  unacceptable  and  where individuals have the confidence and trust in the process to disclose, in the knowledge that their concerns will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.

University  College  Dublin  has  six  core  values  driving  our  culture:  Excellence;  Integrity;  Collegiality; Engagement; Diversity and Creativity.  In  line  with  these  values,  the  University  is  committed  to  the provision of an environment of respect for diversity and equality of opportunity where:

- you have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and can work and study in a rewarding, safe and stress free environment;
- sexual misconduct will not be tolerated and can lead to disciplinary action;
- the environment is more likely to enhance performance and achievement which will allow all members of our University community to fully utilise their skills and talents and achieve their full potential.

In  addition,  the  University  wants  to  create  a  climate  of  trust  through  the  provision  of  a  transparent oversight process, to include external membership, and to take a proactive approach to monitoring and publication of statistics and identification of actions to address any patterns of inappropriate behaviour that is arising.

This policy sets out how the University defines sexual misconduct, what it expects of members of the UCD student and employee community, the responsibilities of key roles in the University and how you will be supported when issues of this nature occur.

We  [University  College  Dublin]  recognise  that  sexual  misconduct  -  in  either  a  learning  or  work environment - can cause not only personal distress and anxiety, but also a loss of confidence, low morale and illness. It can also lead to absenteeism from course work or the workplace and interfere with your academic performance and work. You have the right to disclose experiences of unacceptable behaviour while studying or working, to be listened to, to seek support and to have the issue resolved. We also understand that anyone involved in a situation involving sexual misconduct has the right to support and information.

This  policy  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Dignity  and  Respect  Supports  and  Guidance Document and Dignity and Respect Procedure (The Procedure).

## 2. Scope

This Policy applies to all members of our community and others as defined below under Section 3.

Those under the category of 'other' (as defined under section 3) can avail of this policy if they wish to report  or  make  a  formal  complaint  of  bullying  and/or  harassment  against  a  member  of  the  UCD community. If there is any issue in relation to the conduct of those under the category of 'other' (as defined under Section 3), then the policy of the organisation in which they are employed or connected to will normally apply. However, UCD reserves the right to carry out an investigation under this policy taking into account the circumstances of the case. The support services of UCD are applicable to UCD Community members.

This Policy applies to all areas of University operations and programmes. It includes conduct which takes place:

- On our campus
- Other places where our employees or students or others are representing the University or are engaged in a University connected activity.
- At events such as social functions, conferences, sporting events, field trips or work assignments which are related to the University or are a University connected activity.
- In relation to clubs/societies
- At non-UCD connected activities on or off campus including social gatherings involving UCD students and employees, or other members of the UCD community as defined above, where the

alleged incident(s) has a direct impact on the individuals when there is ongoing interaction between the individuals in a university related environment.

- This conduct can be in person, in writing, on the telephone, by e-mail or on the internet and social media.

## Students on Internship/Placements

- Where  UCD  students  on  placement  or  internships  in  other  organisations  wish  to  make  a complaint  of  sexual  misconduct  against  an  individual  in  that  organisation,  the  dignity  and respect policies of that organisation will normally apply.
- Where a UCD student on placement or internship in other organisations has a complaint made against them, they will be subject to UCD policy and they may be subject to the policy of that organisation also.
- Where a UCD student on placement or internship in another organisation makes a complaint against another UCD student on placement/internship in that organisation, they will be subject to UCD policy and they may be subject to the policy of that organisation also.
- In some situations, based on the circumstances of the case, UCD and the host organisation may need to agree on who should lead the investigation process.

## Employees on Secondment

- Where a UCD employee is on secondment in another organisations and wishes to make a complaint of bullying and/or harassment against an individual in that organisation, the dignity and respect policies of that organisation will normally apply.
- Where a UCD employee on secondment in another organisation has a complaint made against them,  they  will  be  subject  to  UCD  policy  and  they  may  be  subject  to  the  policy  of  that organisation also.
- Where a UCD employee on secondment in another organisation makes a complaint against another UCD employee also on secondment in that organisation, they will be subject to UCD policy and they may be subject to the policy of that organisation also.
- In some situations, based on the circumstances of the case, UCD and the host organisation may need to agree on who should lead the investigation process.

There will be no time limit regarding receipt of complaints by the University. The focus will not be on the length of time to bring the complaint forward but rather the impact of the delay on the likelihood of a fair investigation being carried out. The impact of the delay will need to be determined by the Screening Panel based on the information they receive as part of the formal complaint and they will consider the following:

- The circumstances of the alleged complaint
- The complexity of the alleged complaint
- The cause of the delay
- Possibility of prejudice to the respondent.

If  the  Screening  Panel confirms, based on the information they have received as part of the formal complaint, that impact of the delay will not impinge on the likelihood of a fair investigation, an external investigator may be appointed. The external investigator, based on the information received as part of the investigation, can recommend that by reason of the passage of time and taking into account the considerations referred to above, a fair investigation will not be possible.

In the event of the death of a respondent, an investigation will not proceed.

It is possible for an individual to feel they have also been subjected to bullying and/or harassment. If this is the case, please refer also to the policy on Bullying and Harassment.

## 3. Definitions

It is important that you make yourself aware of the definitions below as it will help determine whether the policy applies to your own situation. It will also make you aware of the type of behaviour that is not acceptable and which you should not engage in. These definitions have been developed based on a review  of  best  practice,  Codes  of  Practice,  extensive  consultation,  the  National  Framework,  Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive: Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions, 2019. The fact that the person who caused the offence may not have intended to engage in sexual misconduct is not a defence, it is the impact of the behaviour that is considered. It is important to note that whilst some behaviours may not fall under the definitions as outlined below, the University does not tolerate unacceptable behaviour of any type. Please refer to Section  6 below on Related Documents for information on other related policies.

## 1 Sexual Misconduct:

1 Safe, Respectful, Supportive and Positive: Ending Sexual Violence and Harassment in Irish Higher Education Institutions, 2019. Definition of Sexual Misconduct

Sexual Misconduct covers a broad range of inappropriate and unwanted behaviours of a sexual nature including sexual harassment and sexual violence. Sexual misconduct can be committed by a person of any gender and it can occur between people of the same or different genders. It is often gender targeted and perpetrated to demean, diminish and intimidate. Sexual misconduct may occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved, or formerly involved, in an intimate or sexual relationship.

The following are examples of behaviours associated with sexual misconduct (non-exhaustive list)

- Predicating inclusion or access to work or study opportunities or other advantages on participation in interactions of a sexual nature
- Grooming, psychological abuse and coercive contact
- Controlling, coercive and threatening behaviour including all or some forms of domestic abuse (emotional, physical, financial, sexual including threats) by a partner or ex-partner.
- Making unwanted remarks of a sexual nature, either directly, or via text or social media apps.
- Sharing private sexual materials of another person without consent;
- Any behaviour of a sexual nature that is committed without consent
- Kissing without consent.
- Touching inappropriately through clothes without consent.
- Non-consensual taking or sharing of intimate images.
- Sexual harassment/sexual misconduct on social media.
- Verbal or physical harassment in a sexual context.
- Inappropriately showing sexual organs to another person
- Creating, accessing, viewing or distributing child pornography material online or offline.
- Stalking behaviours whether online or offline.
- A  promise  of  resources,  access  to  education,  opportunities  and  career  progression  in exchange for sexual access
- All  forms  of  sexual  violence  including  attempting  to  engage  in  sexual  intercourse  or engaging in a sexual act without consent.
- Misuse of power, by academic or professional staff towards students or more junior levels of employee or misuse of power in a relationship between students or employees who have unequal institutional power.

This definition of Sexual Misconduct also embraces Sexual Harassment (as defined below).

## Sexual Harassment

Sexual Harassment is defined under the Employment Equality Acts 1998 - 2015. It includes any act of physical intimacy, request for sexual favours, other act or conduct including spoken words, gestures or the production, display or circulation of written words, picture or other material that is unwelcome and could reasonably be regarded as sexually offensive, humiliating or intimidating.

The following are examples of behaviours associated with sexual harassment: (non-exhaustive list)

Physical contact such as unnecessary touching, patting or pinching or brushing against another body, assault, coercive sexual intercourse or rape.

- Sexual advances, propositions or pressure for sexual activity, continued suggestions for social activity after it has been made clear that such suggestions are unwelcome, unwanted or offensive flirtations, suggestive remarks, innuendos or lewd comments
- The  display  of  pornographic  or  sexually  suggestive  pictures,  objects,  written  materials including posters, emails, text-messages, social media messaging or faxes
- Leering, whistling or making sexually suggestive gestures
- Conduct that denigrates or ridicules or is intimidatory or physically abusive of a person because of their sex

The Employment Equality Acts 1998 - 2015 do not prohibit all relations of a sexual or social nature at work.  To  constitute  harassment/sexual  harassment  the  behaviour  complained  of  must  firstly  be unwelcome. It is up to each employee/student/other (e.g. visitor or sub-contractor) to decide

- (a) what behaviour is unwelcome, irrespective of the attitude of others to the matter and
- (b) from whom such behaviour is welcome or unwelcome, irrespective of the attitudes
- of others to the matter

The fact that an individual has previously agreed to the behaviour does not stop them from deciding that  it  has  become  unwelcome.  It  is  the  unwanted  nature  of  the  conduct  which  distinguishes harassment/sexual harassment from behaviour which is welcome and mutual.

In addition, to constitute harassment/sexual harassment under the Employment Equality Acts 1998 2015, the behaviour must have the purpose or effect of violating a person's dignity and creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for that person.

## Consent

Consent  in  the  context  of  sexual  misconduct  is  defined  as  the  freely  given  verbal  or  non-verbal communication of a feeling of willingness to engage in sexual activity. A person consents to a sexual act if they freely and voluntarily agree to engage in that act. There is no consent if the victim is asleep or  unconscious;  force  or  the  threat  of  force  is  used;  they  cannot  consent  because  of  the  effect  of alcohol/other drug; they cannot communicate consent because of a physical and mental disability; they are mistaken about the act or about the identity of the other person; the only indication of consent came from  a  third  person,  or  if  they  are  being  unlawfully  detained  at  the  time  of  the  act.  This  is  not  an exhaustive list and are illustrative only.

Consent can be withdrawn at any time, and just because someone has previously given consent, does not preclude that person from withdrawing consent.

Non-consensual sexual activity may amount to a prosecutable criminal offence.

This definition is consistent with the definition of consent in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. The full definition is included under Section 6 below.

## Disclosure

In the context of this policy, disclosure refers to the case where an individual discloses that they feel they  have  been  subjected  to  sexual  misconduct,  which  includes  sexual  harassment  and  sexual violence.  Making  a  disclosure  does  not  constitute  a  formal  complaint,  however  after  speaking  with someone, you may decide to then submit a formal complaint. When making a disclosure, you will be supported to work through the issue by a trained support person, such as the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor, and discuss what a resolution would look like for you, with safety for everyone being  of  paramount  importance.  You  will  also  be  signposted  towards  other  internal  and  external supports. You will be made aware of your right to make a formal complaint and/or contact the Gardaí (Police) in the case of an alleged criminal offence.

## Reporting Person

A reporting person is defined as an individual that has come forward to report an incident(s) that they consider to be sexual misconduct type behaviour, however they have not submitted a formal complaint form.

## Person being Reported

A person being reported is defined as the individual that the reporting person considers to be carrying out the sexual misconduct type behaviour, however no formal complaint form has been submitted.

## Informal Resolution

Informal  resolution  refers  to  the  options  available  to  resolve  an  issue  without  instigating  the  formal investigation  procedure.  The  appropriateness  of  informal  interventions  in  instances  of  sexual misconduct will depend on the nature of the conduct.

The key principle to be maintained is that individuals reporting allegations of sexual misconduct, with the appropriate supports, should be the decision maker around whatever actions should be taken and the possible routes and actions towards informal resolution should be explored when they are engaging with University and/or external supports.

Informal resolution options include the reported person being contacted to let the person being reported know that the  alleged  behaviour  described is  not  acceptable  and  is  in  contravention  of  the  Sexual Misconduct policy and should stop. The reporting person may also wish to consider other options that they feel will assist them in resolving the issue informally. In helping determine if this option may be appropriate, the health and safety of all parties would be of paramount importance.

Reporting persons are advised to discuss options for resolution with the Dignity and Respect Support Services Advisor.

## Formal Complaint

A complaint is deemed to be formal once the Dignity and Respect complaint form has been completed and submitted to the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) unit. Following receipt of a formal complaint, a preliminary screening carried out by a screening panel will decide on a prima facie basis whether the alleged behaviour falls within the definition of sexual misconduct and scope as defined in this policy. The screening panel can also recommend if informal interventions should be considered. If deemed to fall  within  the  definitions  and  scope  and  informal  interventions  are  deemed  inappropriate  by  the screening panel, or the complainant does not wish to engage in informal interventions, the complaint will  proceed  to  a  formal  investigation  which  will  be  supported  by  either  UCD  HR  or  the  Students Engagement, Conduct, Complaints and Appeals office, as appropriate. If the Screening Panel finds that the behaviour does not fall within the definitions and scope of sexual misconduct, the panel may direct the complaint to an alternative process. Consideration will be given to the fact that a formal complaint form  has  already  been  completed  in  relation  to  the  issues.  Further  information  in  relation  to  the screening panel and formal investigation process is located in the Formal Complaints Procedure.

## Complainant

The complainant is a person who makes a formal complaint, using the Dignity and Respect complaint form, that they have been subject to sexual misconduct .

## Respondent

The respondent is a person who is named in a formal complaint as having allegedly carried out the sexual misconduct.

## Precautionary Measures

If a person makes a formal complaint of sexual misconduct, reasonable precautionary measures may be put in place pending the outcome of a University or criminal investigation process. A precautionary measure is not a penalty or a sanction and does not indicate that it has been concluded that the person concerned  has  committed  a  breach  of  discipline  or  a  criminal  offence.  Rather  these  precautionary measures may be put in place in the best interests of all parties involved, including any witnesses. Precautionary measures may potentially be kept in place following an intervention depending on the circumstances. (Further information on the range of measures are outlined in the formal Investigation Procedures document).

## Discrimination

The Employment Equality Acts 1998 - 2015 defines discrimination as treating one person in a less favourable way than another person based on any of the equality grounds (see grounds listed under harassment).  These  include  recruitment  and  promotion;  equal  pay;  working  conditions;  training  or experience; dismissal and harassment including sexual harassment. Claims of discrimination (other than harassment and sexual harassment) are managed under the Grievance Procedure for employees or Student Complaints (or other) for students.

## Victimisation

No person should be the subject of any act or omission that affects them to their detriment for having raised  sexual  misconduct,  making  a  formal  complaint  in  good  faith,  for  giving  evidence  in  an investigation  (as  a  witness/bystander  for  example)  or  by  giving  notice  of  intention  to  do  so.  The University takes victimisation very seriously and action will be taken in instances where this occurs. Any individual  that  experiences  victimisation  is  strongly  encouraged  to  seek  support  and  report  this behaviour to the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor or EDI Unit.

## Penalisation

The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 (the '2005 Act') prohibits employers from penalising employees for making complaints in respect of health and safety matters in the workplace. Penalisation under the 2005 Act is defined as any act or omission of an employer which affects a term or condition of employment of an employee to their detriment. Penalisation could include suspending, demoting, dismissing an employee or reducing their wages. It could also include coercion or intimidation.

## Dignity and Respect Environmental Assessment

A  Dignity  and  Respect  Environmental  Assessment  is  an  assessment  of  the  broader  cultural issues/prevailing conditions within an area. A periodic environmental assessment may be undertaken at  intervals  as  directed  by  a  sub-group  of  the  Dignity  and  Respect  Oversight  group  where  a  small number of areas will be randomly selected by the sub-group.

A targeted Dignity and Respect Environmental Assessment may also occur where particular statistical trends have been highlighted. These trends may be identified through anonymous reports made by individuals (reporting person) in the  2 Report and Support Tool for example or where an individual(s) have come forward informally to report an incident but do(es) not wish to make a formal complaint at that point in time. Trends may also be identified where bystanders/witnesses have reported incidents. These assessments will help measure how well this policy is being embedded across the University and its impact.

2  Report and Support provides the opportunity for you to make the University aware of incidents that you have either experienced or witnessed by reporting them anonymously. More information can be found at reportandsupport.ucd.ie

The  Dignity  and  Respect  Oversight  Sub-Group  will  monitor  this  data  on  a  quarterly  basis.  If  an environmental assessment of an area is identified, either on a periodic review basis or arising from a review of data available, the area must cooperate with the assessment. All environmental assessments will be conducted by an independent third party. A Dignity and Respect Environmental Assessment will not result in any sanctions being issued, however it gives the University the authority to implement action plans aimed at changing culture or behaviours.

The framework for these assessments is currently under development through a sectoral project sponsored by the Irish Universities Association. It is still in the pilot phase and has not yet been rolled out in the sector. This policy will be updated once the framework is available.

## Malicious Complaint

Adopting the definition under the Code of Code of Practice on Bullying 2021, a malicious complaint can be described as an allegation being made without foundation, and with malicious intent, where a person knowingly or without regard to whether  it  is  true  or  not,  accuses  another  person  of  alleged  sexual misconduct against them. This could also apply to where one person maliciously complains of someone allegedly engaged in sexual misconduct with a third party, without fully exploring the veracity of the claim. A malicious complaint has the power to disrupt another person's life to a significant extent and the potential damage should not be underestimated. Being accused of sexual misconduct can have a serious impact on any person and reduce their reputation in the eyes of others, even if later shown to not  have  been  proven.  Those  making  complaints  -  and  those  involved  in  early  assessment  of  the circumstances of a complaint - should always be mindful of the context and situational aspects of the event and accept the different perspectives and points of view different people bring to the same event. Making a malicious complaint, if proven, can have serious implications for the employment / studies of the person making such a complaint and this includes disciplinary action, where established.

## 4. Principles

The key principles of the policy are to:

- Ensure that the University has proactive measures in place to promote a positive culture of dignity and respect and to create a working and learning environment which makes clear the expectations  of  members  of  our  community  with  regard  to  respecting  each  other  and  that unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated.
- Create a safe and respectful environment where people feel encouraged to disclose the issues they are experiencing and have trust and confidence in the process that the issues will be dealt with appropriately and fairly.
- Ensure that there is a range of trained supports available, both voluntary and full-time dedicated roles, whom you can approach and seek support and guidance from and that these are widely communicated.
- Promote understanding of our definitions of sexual misconduct and consent.
- Ensure that there are both informal and formal options available for resolution acknowledging that informal options need to be considered carefully.
- Enhance transparency by having external expert involvement at key stages of the dignity and respect process including external membership on the screening panel, the appointment of external investigators and external membership on the EDI Dignity and Respect Oversight SubGroup.
- Expectation that you will cooperate with all efforts in order to resolve complaints under the policy and without undue delay as appropriate.
- Expectation that you will respect the confidentiality of the process. However, you are strongly encouraged to seek support from the support services available, your family and other personal supports which will involve you sharing information confidentially with them.
- Have  an  effective  and  transparent  monitoring  and  analysis  process  of  dignity  and  respect related data, and the reporting of this data to relevant internal and external bodies on a defined periodic basis in order to demonstrate accountability.
- Review  this  Policy  on  a  regular  basis  in  line  with  changes  in  the  law,  relevant  case-law, feedback from people's experience of the policy or other developments.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

As members of our community, we are all expected to work to develop and maintain a high degree of respect in our diverse community and to participate in creating a positive and safe environment.

As with all policies and procedures, this document assigns responsibilities to a range of roles within the University,  including  senior  management  of  the  University.  Failure  to  uphold  the  responsibilities assigned is taken very seriously and may lead to informal or formal action, including, in the case of students, under the Student Code and Student Discipline Procedure, and in the case of employees under the Disciplinary Statute (Statute 28). Formal sanctions available for breach of university policies and procedures are graduated by reference to the seriousness of  the breach, for students ranging between a written reprimand to permanent expulsion from the University, and for employees at all levels ranging between a verbal warning to dismissal.

## Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors

Reporting to Equality Diversity and Inclusion, the full-time roles of Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors will work proactively with employees and students who disclose issues of sexual misconduct and those who are reported. These roles, who are experienced and trained to support, respond and advise on all reports of a dignity and respect nature, will provide you with a supportive, confidential environment in which to discuss the issues and support you to make a decision that is right for you and your situation.

As a reporting person, these roles will provide support and work with you in relation to the steps to seeking a solution to the issues you are experiencing but the decision will rest with you as to how you would like the issue to be resolved.

As a person being reported, the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors are also available to support you if you have been accused of carrying out such behaviour however different advisors will support the various people involved to avoid a conflict of interest. If a formal complaint has been made, they  will  provide  information  as  to  what  this  will  normally  entail.  They  may  accompany  you  to investigations if you wish and also provide aftercare support.

The Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors will also support, and work closely with the panel of Dignity and Respect Contact Persons, who are trained voluntary support roles available to those

The Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor roles are available during normal working hours, however in the case of emergency the Duty Manager in Estate Services is available at any time day or night on 716 7999 and has a direct contact to the Gardaí (Police) if required.

The key responsibilities of the roles include:

- Providing impartial information and support around options in relation to resolving issues of a sexual misconduct nature.
- Supporting and guiding the reporting person in making a formal complaint if they wish to do so.
- Accompanying complainants and respondents to investigation meetings if they wish and providing after care support following a formal investigation process regardless of the outcome.
- Signposting and referring individuals to other appropriate support services both within the University and externally.
- Keeping accurate records to a safe, professional and ethical standard and monitor and report statistical data.

## People Managers (Heads of School/Unit and those with line management responsibilities) (for employees)

People managers have important roles to play in creating a culture of dignity and respect in their School/Unit and supporting employees who are experiencing issues of dignity and respect, with support from HR. There may be instances where an individual may feel that there is a conflict of interest in approaching their line managers where the issue is with the line manager or if both individuals involved report to the same manager. In this instance, individuals can approach the next management level up or contact the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor as well as seek support from the other sources of support available.

The role of the People Manager is to:

- At all times, treat all members of the University community with dignity and respect.
- Proactively promote ongoing awareness in relation to dignity and respect in their area including keeping dignity and respect as a regular agenda item at School/Unit meetings.
- Work with those involved in a sexual misconduct issue in a proactive manner to support the resolution of issues and stop the unacceptable behaviour. Seek advice from HR and the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor as well as engaging with other people managers to seek support and advice (anonymously) in relation to addressing issues of dignity and respect in their areas.
- Undertake appropriate training and be able to explain the policy and the supports to employees in their area.
- Encourage employees to come forward to report issues and to encourage them to seek support and guidance from the Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisors and other supports that can assist in the resolution of issues.
- Monitor and follow up on the situation to ensure that unwelcome and non-consensual behaviour does not occur or recur.
- Be vigilant for signs of sexual misconduct through observation and by getting feedback and to take appropriate action before a matter escalates.
- Where unwelcome behaviour has occurred, and is admitted, be clear that it is not acceptable and to take disciplinary action if appropriate.
- Work with HR to take precautionary measures as deemed reasonable by the University.
- Facilitate and/or pro-actively request environmental assessments in their area and encourage participation  by  students  and  employees,  ensuring  that  they  are  supported  throughout  the process.

They can play an important role in providing information, advice and support to students who feel that they are being subject to sexual misconduct or against whom a complaint has been made. They assist students by providing a listening ear and signposting to Student Advisers and Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor for specialist support and guidance.

## Role of Bystanders

A  bystander  in  the  context  of  this  policy  is  an  individual  that  witnesses  an  incident(s)  of  sexual misconduct. As a bystander, you are encouraged to report any incidents witnessed to your Head of School/Module Co-ordinator or Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor in the case of students and in the case of employees, your manager or Dignity and Respect Support Service Advisor who will advise as to the various options available to address the issues.

|                            | (4) Consent to a sexual act may be withdrawn at any time before the act begins, or in the case of a continuing act, while the act is taking place.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|                            | (5) Any failure or omission on the part of a person to offer resistance to an act does not of itself constitute consent to that act.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| (6) In this section-   |
|------------------------|

| 'sexual act' means-                                                                             |

| (i) sexual intercourse, or                                                                      |

| (b) an act described in section 3(1) or 4(1) of this Act, or                                    |
| (c) an act which if done without consent would constitute a sexual assault;                     |
| 'sexual intercourse' shall be construed in accordance with section 1(2) of the Principal Act.'. |

## c) Confidentiality (see Data Privacy statement)

Confidentiality will be observed as far as practicable and in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection  Act  2003  -  2018  and  the  Children  First  Act,  2015  which  governs  child  protection. Confidentiality is a key principle of the Dignity and Respect policy and is essential to the integrity of a formal complaints process. It is important that any party to a complaint, which most commonly includes reporting  person/complainant,  person  being  reported/respondent  or  witness,  does  not  breach confidentiality.  This  does  not  preclude  parties  to  the  complaint  from  accessing  confidential  support services  and  confiding  in  them  such  as  the  Employee  Assistance  Service  or  Student  Counselling, speaking  to  a  designated  dignity  and  respect  contact  person  or  a  student  advisor,  trade  union representative, accompanying person or human resources or other support. Respect for an individual's request for confidentiality will be maintained (as far as practicable) except in any or all of the following situations:

- In situations where there is a risk that a Respondent may repeat their actions and pose a real physical/mental threat to the well-being of others. If this situation arises, the HR Director or the Registrar, as appropriate, must be contacted and there will be full disclosure to them.
- Where failure to disclose information may be a breach of statute
- Where an individual is a minor
- Where there is a potential risk to the University.

The University will take action that is necessary and proportionate in order to protect the rights of the reporting person/complainant, person being reported/respondent or witness involved in an investigation.

## d) Investigations by An Garda Síochána (Police)/ Court orders

- i. Where an employee/student identifies a breach of this policy which constitutes a criminal offence  or  an  immediate  threat  to  safety,  they  should  report  the  matter  to  the  Gardaí. Individuals should also inform the University through their line manager or the Dignity and Respect Report and Support Adviser, so that appropriate steps can be taken and support

provided.  Employees  or  students  can  contact  the  Gardaí  directly  or  through  the  Duty Manager in Estate Services who has access to a contact point in Donnybrook Garda

Station at any time, day or night. The Duty manager can be contacted on Extension 716 7999.

The University  will  only  in  the  most  exceptional  circumstances,  and  with  the  benefit  of specific legal advice, report a complaint to the Gardaí contrary to the wishes of the reporting person/complainant. The circumstance in which a report by a University may be justified is if  there  is  considered  to  be  a  clear  and  imminent  risk  to  the  safety  of  the  reporting person/complainant or of third parties. If the University does decide that it is necessary to report the allegation to the Gardaí, then the reasons for taking that action will be explained to the complainant so that they understand what is happening and they can be prepared if/when the Gardaí contact them. Further details are located in the Dignity and Respect Formal Investigation Procedures.

- ii. If any individual has a court order against a UCD community member, they should provide a copy of this to the Dignity and Respect Support and Report Advisor. When the university is put on notice of a court order it will take all reasonable steps to facilitate compliance with the  order  where  possible.  Enforcement  of  the  order  is  however  a  matter  for  the applicant/court.

## d) The Children's First Act 2015 and Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012

The  University  is  obliged  to  report  any  disclosures  of  child  sexual  abuse,  assault,  illtreatment, or neglect of children to Tusla under the reporting responsibilities of the Children First Act 2015, the 2017 Guidance, the University's Child Safeguarding Statement and the principles of natural justice. Any person to whom such a report is made should contact the UCD Child Protection Officer.  The  University  also  has  a  reporting  obligation  under  the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 . The Act creates a criminal offence of withholding information relating to the commission of a serious offence, including a sexual offence, against a person under 18 years or a vulnerable person.

## e) Transparency through Monitoring and Reporting

We are committed to being transparent in relation to issues of sexual misconduct in the University whilst still protecting anonymity. Data relating to complaints and reports of sexual misconduct will be used to inform  the  development  of  initiatives  and  activities  designed  to  prevent  such  behaviour,  enhance supports for those experiencing sexual misconduct and promote a safe and respectful environment for all.

A report including an analysis of data collated in relation to contacts, reports, formal complaints and anonymous reports via the University's anonymous Report and Support system and, where appropriate, relevant recommendations will be submitted to the University Management Team and EDI Group on a quarterly basis and annually to the Governing Authority. Data will also be made available to the Dignity and Respect Oversight sub-group through a data collection system that will be established to enable the group to identify areas for targeted environmental assessments.

Specifically, the report will include:
