## Research Data Management - UCD Policy

Policy owner

UCD Research &amp; Innovation

## 1. Purpose

University College Dublin recognises that the management of research data is fundamental to both high quality  research  and  academic  integrity.  Accurate  and  retrievable  research  data  is  an  essential component of any research project and is necessary to verify and defend the process and outcomes of research.

Research data is valuable to researchers for the duration of their research, and may well have longterm  value  for  research,  teaching  and  for  wider  exploitation  for  the  public  good  by  individuals, government, business and other organisations.

The  objective  of  the  Research  Data  Management  (RDM)  Policy  is  to  provide  a  framework  for  the management of research data to ensure that research data is stored, retained, made available for use and reuse, and disposed of according to best international practices for data management, as well as in  compliance with legal, statutory,  ethical, contractual and intellectual property obligations, and the requirements of funding bodies and publishers.

## 2. Definitions

## UCD Community means

- all UCD employees, whether part time or full time, permanent or temporary;
- all employees of UCD's wholly owned subsidiary companies or overseas campus/offices;
- all registered students of UCD;
- non-University employees who use University funds, facilities or other resources, including the University's name and reputation, to carry out teaching and/or research, and/or participate in UCD-administered research, including retired employees, visiting faculty and researchers; consultants, contractors, affiliated hospital staff, industrial personnel and research fellows, regardless of obligations to other companies or institutions; and
- all persons conducting teaching and/or research at or under the auspices of UCD including at any  of  UCD's  overseas  campus,  including  visiting  faculty  and  researchers;  consultants; contractors, Emeritus or adjunct appointments; and research fellows.

Researchers are defined as members of the UCD Community carrying out research.

Research data is information collected to be examined and considered, and to serve as a basis for reasoning, discussion or calculation. It is used as a primary source to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic activity, is used as evidence in the research process, and/or is  commonly  accepted  in  the  research  community  as  necessary  to  validate  research  findings  and results. Examples of research data are experimental data, observational data, operational data, third

party  data,  public  sector  data,  monitoring  data,  or  repurposed  data.    The  focus  in  this  policy  is  on research data that is available in either electronic or paper form.

Research data lifecycle is the sequence of stages that a particular unit of data goes through from its initial generation or capture to its eventual archival and/or deletion at the end of its planned life.

A secure environment is  a  system  or  facility  which  implements  the  controlled  storage  and  use  of research data.

A data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data is to be handled both during a research project and after the project is completed. Data management plans must assure that research data is traceable, available, authentic, citable, properly stored and that it adheres to clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate safety measures governing subsequent use.

## 3. Scope

The scope of the policy covers research data created or managed by Researchers.

## 4. Principles

- (1)  The  University  promotes  best  practice  for  research  data  management  through  clear  policy, guidance, supervision, training and support.
- (2)  Researchers,  service  providers  and,  where  appropriate,  research  sponsors  and  external collaborators should work in partnership to implement good practice.
- (3)  Research  data  will  be  managed  by  Researchers  to  the  highest  standards  throughout  the research data lifecycle as part of the University's commitment to research excellence.
- (4)  Research  data  should  be  compliant  to  the  principles  of  FAIR  data  (Findable,  Accessible, Interoperable, Re-Useable):
- Findable: Identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed;
- Accessible: Able to be made available to others in line with appropriate legal, statutory (including  data  protection  regulations),  ethical,  contractual,  intellectual  property,  data sharing  and  open  access  principles  in  a  suitable  repository  or  archiving  system  with persistent identifiers.
- Interoperable: Should be accurate, complete, authentic and reliable, and where possible made available in non-proprietary formats that facilitate data exchange and re-use;
- Re-Useable:  Assigned  a  licence  for  open  use  where  possible  in  compliance  with intellectual property rights, and if no third-party rights, data protection, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it.
- (5)  Research data should be kept in a manner that is compliant with legal and ethical obligations and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies, publishers and protocols set out in the National Policy Statement on Ensuring Research Integrity in Ireland.
- (6)  Research data should be retained in a secure environment for as long as it is of continuing value to the researcher and the wider research community, and as long as specified by research funder,  publisher,  patent  law,  legislative  and  other  regulatory  requirements.  The  normal minimum retention period for research data is ten years after publication or public release of the work of the research. (Longer periods apply in certain cases, such as in relation to historical data.) If data includes personal or sensitive information, informants must be informed of the data retention policy at the time data is collected, in compliance with data protection regulations.
- (7)  If research data is to be deleted or destroyed, either because the agreed period of retention has expired or for legal or ethical reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal,

ethical,  research  funder  and  collaborator  requirements  and  with  particular  concern  for confidentiality and security.

- (8)  If a personal data breach occurs, it is to be dealt with in accordance with UCD data protection policies.
- (9)  Increasingly, research projects are funded by external parties and/or involve collaboration with third parties such as other research performing organisations, charities, industry, etc.  In such cases, contractual requirements such as the funder's terms and conditions, grant agreement(s), collaboration agreement(s), industry contract(s) etc. may apply to the project. These contractual requirements  constitute  legally  binding  obligations  on  the  University  and  the  Researchers involved in the project, and often include specific provisions regarding ownership, management, retention and access to data, confidentiality obligations, IT security, publication requirements etc.  Contractual obligations apply in addition to the principles and requirements contained in this policy.  If there is a conflict between this policy and a contractual obligation, the contractual obligation will override the requirements of this policy and it is the researcher's responsibility to ensure compliance.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

Researchers are responsible for:

- Managing research data in accordance with the principles above;
- Developing and documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention or destruction of the research data and records associated with their research. This shall include, where appropriate, defining protocols and responsibilities in a joint or multiinstitution  collaborative  research  project.  This  information  should  be  incorporated,  where appropriate, in a research data management plan. For research that includes personal data, the researcher needs to identify what contracts or agreements with collaborators or contractors are required to satisfy data protection obligations;
- Planning for the ongoing custodianship (at the University or using third-party services) of their data after the completion of the research or, in the event of their departure or retirement from the University, reaching agreement with the Head of School/Institute Director (or their nominee) as to where such data will be located and how this will be stored. Where personal data is part of  the  research  data,  it  has  to  be  assured  that  any  agreement  made  is  in  line  with  the communication provided to and reasonable expectations of research participants;
- Ensuring  that  any  requirements  in  relation  to  research  data  management  placed  on  their research by publishers, funding bodies or regulatory agencies or under the terms of a research contract with the University are also met.

The University provides resources to facilitate Researchers in meeting their responsibilities, in the form of supporting services and expert advice as well as technical infrastructures. Information on available supports  is  available  at  the  online  UCD  Research  Portal.  The  University  is  committed  to,  and  will maintain oversight of, good practice in research data management. To this end, it reserves the right to verify  that  all  research  data  has  been  kept  in  a  manner  that  is  compliant  with  this  policy  and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and publishers.

## 6. Personal data and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018.  It is intended to strengthen  data  protection  for  individuals  across  the  EU,  and  imposes  increased  obligations  on organisations  that  process  personal  data.    Processing  is  very  broadly  defined  as  the  collection, storage, recording, disclosure of, structuring, making available and erasure or destruction.  The GDPR

applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether  or  not  the  processing  takes  place  in  the  EU,  and  furthermore  it  restricts  the  transfer  of personal data to locations outside the EU unless certain conditions or safeguards are in place. At the core of the GDPR are seven principles which must be observed by all data controllers and processors. These are transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality and accountability.

The definition of personal data is broad under the GDPR and encompasses ' any information relating to an identified  or identifiable  natural person '.    The  GDPR specifically includes ' location data ',  ' online identifiers ' such as IP addresses and ' genetic ' data as examples of personal data. Certain categories of personal data attract a greater level of protection under the GDPR. These include: personal data relating to racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, religious/philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health and biometric data, and data concerning sex life or sexual orientation.  However, the GDPR does not  apply  to  fully  anonymised  or  aggregated  data  where  a  living  individual  cannot  under  any circumstances ever be identified or singled out.

If your research data includes personal data as defined under the GDPR it is very important that the following  are  consulted:  Article  9  of  GDPR,  UCD  GDPR  website  and  the  Health  Research  Board's GDPR guidance for researchers.
