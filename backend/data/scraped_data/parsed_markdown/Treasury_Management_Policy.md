## 1.0 Treasury Management Policy Statement

This document sets out the treasury management objectives, policies and practices of  University  College  Dublin  ('UCD'  or  the  'University')  and  its  subsidiaries  (the 'Policy').

The Policy has been reviewed and recommended by the Finance, Remuneration and Asset Management Committee ('FRAMC') and approved by the Governing Authority.

UCD  defines  treasury  management  as  the  management  of  the  University's  cash flows,  its  banking,  money  market  and  capital  market  transactions,  the  effective control  of  the  risk  associated  with  those  activities,  and  the  pursuit  of  optimum performance consistent with those risks.

UCD regards the successful balancing of risk and return to be the prime criteria by which  the  effectiveness  of  its  treasury  management  activities  will  be  measured. Accordingly, the analysis and reporting of treasury management activities will focus on their risk implications for the organisation (including the identification, monitoring, and control of risks) and the returns achieved on treasury management activities. Accordingly, the primary objective will be to ensure the security of the principal sums invested and secondly to optimise returns on its investments.

UCD  acknowledges  that  effective  treasury  management  will  provide  support towards  the  achievement  of  its  business  objectives.  The  specific  operational arrangements  and  risk  controls  which  seek  to  ensure  compliance  with  these objectives are set out in Schedules 1.1.1 of this document.

## 1.1.1 Key Objectives

The key objectives of the Treasury Management function are to:

- To safeguard the monetary assets of UCD
- Ensure sufficient liquidity to meet UCD's funding requirements both in the short and long term.
- Invest surplus cash securely, with approved counterparties using approved instruments and within the liquidity and maturity constraints set out in this Policy.
- Ensure that UCD can service any external debt/borrowing by effective management of interest expense and adhere to financial covenants.
- Oversee and maintain effective banking arrangements, including banking relationships.
- To perform all treasury activities in accordance with the parameters outlined in this Policy and the Responsible Investment Policy (when approved).

## 2.0 Treasury Management Practices

## 2.1.1 Treasury Risk Management

- UCD  adopts  a  risk-averse  approach  to  treasury  management.  UCD  enters  into  treasury transactions for the purposes of controlling risk and/or securing a reasonable return whilst controlling  risk  in  the  case  of  surplus  liquidity.  UCD  does  not  engage  in  high-risk  or speculative transactions.

- UCD identifies five fundamental treasury risks to which it is exposed. These are: liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate risk, legal/regulatory risk, and operational risk.
- UCD will design, implement, and monitor all arrangements necessary for the identification, management and control of these treasury risks.
- The management of bank deposit and money market investments is part of the treasury management function, as defined above.
- UCD will not expose itself to material exchange rate risk.
- In respect of each treasury risk, UCD adopts the risk management objectives stated below. The specific operational arrangements and risk controls which seek to ensure compliance with these objectives are set out in Schedules 3.1 - 3.7 of this document.

## 2.1.2 Liquidity Risk

- UCD  will  ensure  it  has  adequate  liquidity  through  short-term  cash  resources, committed borrowing arrangements, overdrafts, or standby facilities to enable it at all times to have the level of funds available to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
- In determining the adequate level of liquidity UCD will take into account factors which could cause unexpected net cash outflows such as shortfalls against expected grant receipts.

## 2.1.3 Counterparty Credit Risk

- UCD regards a key objective of its treasury management activities to be the security of the principal sums it invests. Accordingly, it will ensure that its counterparty lists and limits reflect a prudent attitude towards credit risk management. In particular, UCD ranks the security of principal sums invested ahead of yield earned on treasury deposits.
- Surplus cash will be invested so UCD's objectives of security of principal, liquidity and yield, in that order, are met.
- UCD maintains a formal counterparty policy (Schedule 3.3) in respect of those entities with which it may place deposits or invest or arrange borrowings.

## 2.1.4 Interest Rate Risk

- UCD  will  manage  its  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  with  a  view  to containing its interest costs, or securing its interest revenues, in accordance with the parameters specified in this treasury policy.
- No hedging transaction will be entered into without specific FRAMC approval. UCD will ensure that hedging transactions are only used for the management of  risk  and  the  prudent  management  of  financial  affairs,  and  never  for speculation.

## 2.1.5 Legal and Regulatory Risk

- UCD defines Legal and regulatory risk as the risk that the institution itself, or a third party with which it is dealing in its treasury management activities, fails to act in accordance with its legal powers or regulatory requirements, and that the institution suffers loss accordingly. UCD will ensure that all of its treasury management activities comply with its statutory and regulatory requirements.
- UCD recognises that future legislative or regulatory changes may impact on its treasury management activities and, so far as it is reasonably able to do so, will seek to minimize the rise of these impacting adversely on the University.

## 2.1.6 Operational Risk

- UCD will ensure that it identifies situations where treasury operations may expose it to the risk of loss through error, fraud or other eventualities. Accordingly, it will employ suitable treasury systems, controls and procedures and will at all times maintain effective contingency management arrangements.

## 2.2 Performance Measurement and Value for Money

- UCD is  committed to the pursuit  of  value  for  money  in  its  treasury  management activities and to the use of performance measurement methodology in support of that aim.
- Accordingly,  the  treasury  management  function  will  be  subjected  to  continuous review in terms of its effectiveness and the value it adds in support of UCD's business objectives, including regular examination of alternative methods of service delivery and of the scope for other potential improvements.
- The performance of the treasury management function will be measured using the criteria set out in Schedule 3.8 to this document .

## 2.3 Decision Making and Analysis

- UCD will  maintain  comprehensive  records  of  its  treasury  management  decisions  and document the processes and practices applied in reaching those decisions, both for the purposes of learning from the past and for demonstrating that reasonable steps were taken to ensure that all issues relevant to those decisions were taken into account at the time.
- The issues to be addressed and processes and practices to be pursued in reaching treasury decisions are detailed in Schedule 3.9 to this document.

## 2.4 Approved Instruments, Methods and Techniques

- UCD will undertake its treasury management activities by employing only those instruments, methods and techniques detailed in Schedule 3.10 to this document.

## 2.5 Organisation, Clarity, Segregation of Responsibilities, Dealing Arrangements

- UCD considers it essential, for the purposes of the effective control and monitoring of its treasury management activities, for the reduction of the risk of error or fraud and for the

pursuit  of  optimum  performance,  that  there  is,  at  all  times,  complete  clarity  of  treasury management responsibilities.

- The principle on which this will be based is a clear segregation of duties between those charged with implementing treasury management policies and executing transactions with counterparties  and  those  responsible  for  transaction  settlement,  the  execution  and transmission of funds, the recording and administering of treasury management transactions and the audit and review of the treasury management function. UCD recognises that the practical application of this principle must have regard to the limited number of relevant staff in the organisation and will review this requirement in line with growth in staffing levels in the future.
- UCD will ensure that there are clear written statements of the responsibilities and authorities for  those  engaged  in  treasury  management.  UCD  will  also  ensure  that  those  engaged  in treasury management comply with any relevant policies and procedures at all times.
- The responsibilities and delegated authorities in respect of treasury management are set out in Schedule 5 to this document.

## 2.6 Reporting requirement and Management Information arrangements

- UCD will ensure that regular reports are prepared and considered on the implementation of its treasury management policies.
- The present reporting and management information arrangements and the form of reports are detailed in Schedule 3.12 to this document.

## 2.7 Accounting and Auditing Arrangements

- UCD will account for its treasury management activities, for decisions made and transactions executed,  in  accordance  with  appropriate  accounting  practices  and  standards  and  with statutory  and  regulatory  requirements  in  force  for  the  time  being.  UCD  will  always  fully consider  the  accounting  effect  of  any  treasury  management  decisions  under  existing accounting standards and those expected to be applicable in future, seeking specialist advice where appropriate.
- UCD will arrange for a periodic internal audit of the treasury function's policies, practices, systems  and  controls  in  order  to  identify  any  weaknesses  or  failures  in  the  treasury management framework.
- The present arrangements for budgeting, accounting, and auditing are set out in Schedule 3.13 to this document.

## 2.8 Cash and Cashflow Management

- Unless statutory or regulatory requirements demand otherwise, all monies in the hands of UCD will be under the control of UCD Finance Office.
- Cash flow projections will be prepared on a regular and timely basis and the Bursar will ensure that these projections are adequate for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the liquidity risk management policy.

- Cash and cash management is captured by the liquidity risk policy.

## 2.9 Staff Training and Qualifications

- UCD  recognises  the  importance  of  ensuring  that  all  staff  involved  in  the  treasury management function are fully equipped to undertake the various duties and responsibilities allocated to them. It will therefore seek to appoint individuals who are both capable and experienced and will provide training for staff to enable them to acquire and maintain an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and skills.
- The  Director  of  Finance  will  ensure  that  individuals  tasked  with  treasury  management responsibilities have access to training relevant to their needs and those responsibilities. The Director of Finance will recommend and implement any necessary training arrangements.
- Those  charged  with  governance  additionally  recognise  their  individual  responsibility  to ensure that they have the necessary skills to complete their role effectively.
- UCD and its staff will make use of advice and assistance from appropriately experienced specialist  treasury  management  advisers  to  support  its  staff  in  any  area  of  treasury management where it considers that this is necessary.

## 2.10 Use of External Service Providers

- Responsibility for treasury management decisions rests with UCD's Finance Office but UCD recognises that there can be value in engaging external providers of treasury management services, in order to acquire access to specialist skills and resources.
- When  UCD  employs  such  service  providers  (for  example,  treasury  advisors,  investment managers, banks and valuers for loan security purposes) it will ensure it does so for reasons which have been submitted to a full evaluation of the costs and benefits. It will also ensure that the terms of their appointment and the methods by which their value will be assessed are properly agreed and documented and subjected to regular review.
- Where  services  are  subject  to  formal  tender  or  re-tender  arrangements,  legislative requirements  will  always  be  observed.  The  monitoring  of  such  arrangements  is  the responsibility of the Director of Finance.

## 2.11 Corporate Governance

- UCD  is  committed  to  the  pursuit  of  proper  governance  across  all  its  activities  and  to establishing  the  principles  and  practices  by  which  this  can  be  achieved.  Accordingly,  the treasury  management  function  and  its  activities  will  be  undertaken  with  openness, transparency, honesty, integrity and accountability.
- The  Director  of  Finance  will  monitor  and,  if  and  when  necessary,  report  upon  the effectiveness of the corporate governance arrangements in respect of treasury management.

## 3.0 Treasury Policy Schedules

## 3.1 Liquidity Risk Policy

- UCD defines liquidity risk as the risk that cash will not be available when it is needed, that ineffective  management  of  liquidity  creates  additional  unbudgeted  costs  and  that  the institution's business objectives will thereby be compromised.
- UCD  will  ensure  that  it  has  adequate,  though  not  excessive,  cash  resources,  borrowing arrangements, overdraft or standby facilities to enable it at all times to have the level of funds available to it which are necessary for the achievement of its business objectives, including the settlement of all obligations as they fall due.
- For the purpose of this document:
- (i) Cash is defined as cash in UCD's bank accounts or liquid investments which are immediately  convertible  back  into  cash  in  the  bank  (e.g.,  money  market  fund investments and bank term deposits where there is a contractual provision which permits early redemption of the deposit).
- (ii) Liquidity is defined as the sum of UCD's cash, short term liquid investments and term  deposits  with  less  than  1  month  to  maturity  and  undrawn  committed borrowing facilities which are fully secured and available to be drawn or can be fully secured with existing resources within 1 month; and
- (iii) Net  Cash  Requirement  for  a  given  period  is  defined  as  the  net  total  of  all committed cash inflows and all committed cash outflows.

UCD will maintain sufficient Cash to cover the next two months' Net Cash Requirement subject to a minimum Cash balance at all times of €50m plus all balances in ring fenced bank accounts.

- The following Maturity Limits will apply to the investment portfolio:
- To ensure the adequacy of Cash and Liquidity, UCD will monitor cash balances on a daily basis and will prepare the following cash flow forecasts:

| Maturity Horizon   | Limit                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| >36 months         | 0%                      |
| 25-36 months       | 15% of portfolio        |
| 13-24 months       | 40% of portfolio        |
| 1-12 months        | Up to 100% of portfolio |

| Forecast Horizon   | Cash flows                                                                                                                    | Frequency   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Current            | Daily cash report and a month-end cash flow detailing actual cash flows for the month with projected cash flows to year end*. | Monthly     |
| Long term          | 30-year cash flow                                                                                                             | Annually    |

- In the event the minimum liquidity level falls below the €50m threshold, UCD will prepare the following cashflows:
- UCD will undertake reasonable sensitivity analysis, including scenario analysis stress tests, of its  liquidity  position and cash flow projections in order fully to understand the impact of adverse operational and financing scenarios on its Net Cash Requirement and UCD's position against liquidity policy limits.
- UCD will use investment funds only where it has determined that funds invested in such funds will be in excess of the Cash and Liquidity requirements set out above and are placed in funds permitted under this Policy as set out in 3.3 below.
- Where there is a breach of liquidity risk policy, a Treasury Policy Exception Report will be submitted to the FRAMC as detailed in Schedule 3.12.

| Forecast Horizon   | Cash flows                                                                                             | Frequency   |

| Medium term        | 18 months cash flow schedule based on monthly management accounts showing monthly Net Cash Requirement | Monthly     |
| Long term          | 30-year cash flow                                                                                      | Annually    |

## 3.2 Borrowing and Refinancing

- Borrowing, guaranteeing and underwriting shall be carried out in accordance with 'The framework for borrowing and loan guarantees' laid down in the 2019 'Code of Governance for Irish Universities'. Proposals for long term borrowings for funding of projects will be evaluated by the FRAMC having regard to the University's financial position and plans, covenants on existing borrowings and the objectives of this Policy and will not be undertaken without an express decision of the Governing Authority.

## 3.2.1 Security Policy

- UCD will ensure that security granted over its property portfolio is efficiently managed with a view to minimising liquidity risks and optimising future borrowing capacity in light of the business strategy and potential borrowing requirement.

- Where  appropriate,  UCD  will  maintain  minimum  headroom  of  25%  over  asset  cover covenant levels to provide a buffer against unexpected reductions in the security value of charged assets.
- In line with the requirements of the regulatory standards of the European Investment Bank and Housing Finance Agency and any other finance provider, UCD will maintain a thorough, accurate  and  up  to  date  record  of  all  assets  which  are  provided  as  security  against  its borrowings.

## 3.3 Counterparty Credit Risk Policy

- UCD defines credit and counterparty risk as the risk of failure of a third party to meet its contractual  obligation  to  UCD  under  a  treasury  deposit,  investment,  borrowing,  capital project  or  partnership  financing,  particularly  as  a  result  of  the  third  party's  diminished creditworthiness, and the resulting detrimental effect on UCD's capital or revenue resources.
- UCD regards the key objective of its treasury management activities to be the security of the principal sums it invests. Accordingly, it will ensure that its counterparty minimum criteria are set with security in mind, whilst also allowing UCD to avail of market conditions to achieve some return on its deposits/investments. The criteria will be reviewed on a continuing basis.
- UCD maintains the following limits in respect of counterparties with whom it places treasury deposits:

| Asset Category                                        | Min allowed Credit Rating*   | Maximum Limit on each Individual Counterparty   | Maximum Limit on Category   | Counterparty Restrictions                                                                                                                                                      |

All percentage limits refer to percentage of cash available for investment.

- Counterparty Credit Limits apply to combined short-term and long-term deposits. Where the bank is also a lender, UCD will take into account aggregate limits and reliance on right of set off where there is documentation and legal advice that this would apply, although the potential liquidity implications will be considered if a materially higher balance is placed with a single party for this reason.  For  comparison  with  Counterparty  Limits,  principal  amounts  may  be  used  without accruing income.
- Should the clearing bank used by UCD fall below the relevant criteria, consideration will be given to changing banks but the wider context, such as the risk of fraud or operational loss, will also be considered. It may be appropriate to continue using the same clearing bank but to keep overnight balances with that entity at a lower level. Any decision will be kept under review for so long as the threshold breach exists.
- If a Counterparty's credit rating is found to have fallen below the criteria while UCD has funds on deposit with that counterparty, the funds are to be recalled in full at the earliest opportunity. For funds that are on fixed term deposit, the earliest opportunity is defined as on maturity of the relevant deal. Where there is a breech, a Treasury Policy Exception Report will be submitted to the FRAMC as detailed in Schedule 3.12.
- Money Market Funds ('MMF') need to meet the following minimum criteria, as well as the criteria in sections 2.1.3 and 3.3:
- I. Minimum total size of individual MMF: €5bn
- II. Maximum weighted average maturity: 90 days
- III. Constant or Low-Volatility NAV funds
- IV. ESMA Regulated

- UCD will only expose itself to the credit risk of Approved Counterparties. UCD defines an Approved Counterparty as any counterparty approved by the FRAMC.
- Borrowing facilities will only be arranged with counterparties who are judged to have sufficient financial strength to ensure that the funds committed under the facilities will be available as and when they are required by UCD in accordance with the agreed terms.
- Where counterparties are ring-fenced or non-ring-fenced  banks  within  a  group  structure,  the credit rating of the specific legal counterparty will be the rating applied using the above limits and the list of approved counterparties will differentiate where appropriate. It will not be assumed that netting could be achieved across the relevant banking group unless there is documentation and legal advice to the effect that it could be.
- UCD will monitor counterparty credit risk exposures by reviewing the credit ratings of existing counterparties  against  policy  limits  every  quarter.  UCD  will  regularly  review  available  market information on counterparties, such as Credit Default Swap ('CDS') spreads and equity prices, both before exposing itself to the credit risk of a new counterparty and in respect of existing counterparties on an ongoing basis.
- Where there is a breach of a counterparty credit risk policy limit, a Treasury Policy Exception Report will be submitted to the FRAMC as detailed in Schedule 3.12.
- This counterparty credit risk management policy will be reviewed at least annually by FRAMC.

## 3.4 Interest Rate Risk Policy

- UCD considers the management of its exposure to interest rate risk to be a critical element in achieving its business objective. Interest rate risk is the risk that unexpected fluctuations in the levels of interest rates adversely impact UCD's finances as a result of UCD failing to protect itself adequately.
- UCD's preference is generally to seek fixed-rate loans, borrowing at the most competitive rates  with  covenants  in  line  with  regulatory  requirements.  UCD  may  decide  to  explore variable rate loan options on a short-term basis where it considers such loans to be the most cost effective for the University. In that event that Bursar, having taken advice from UCD's Treasury Adviser, will propose a maximum and minimum percentage mix for floating and fixed rate loans and secure appropriate approval for amendment of this Policy, before entry into same.
- This interest rate risk management policy will be reviewed annually by the Finance Office.

## 3.5 Exchange Rate Exposure

- The University's policy is to minimise exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. UCD will retain funds in currencies only to the extent that payments are due to be made in those currencies in the short to medium term. Currency receipts surplus to requirements will be translated into euros at the best rate available timed to allow advantage to be taken of actual and potential advantageous changes in exchange rates.
- The University has two main requirements for foreign currency accounts:

- (i) Summer at UCD U.S. Dollar Account - used for USD Receipts from overseas universities. This account is cleared out to the UCD No. 1 bank account at regular intervals.
- (ii) USD Deposit accounts - used to provide Security for USD Denominated Letter of Credit where this is a requirement of the U.S. Department of Education.
- The University and its subsidiaries also hold a small number of foreign currency accounts 1 in China, Singapore and Northern Ireland to allow it meet certain local liabilities or comply with local legislation. These accounts are funded by UCD, with a policy to keep funding in these accounts to as low a level as possible.

## 3.6 Legal and Regulatory Risk Policy

- UCD defines Legal and Regulatory risk as the risk that UCD itself, or a third party with which it  is  dealing  in  its  treasury  activities,  fails  to  act  in  accordance  with  its  legal  powers  or regulatory requirements and that UCD suffers losses as a result.
- UCD will ensure that its legal and regulatory risks are effectively managed through:
- (i) The  treasury  management  activities  undertaken  by  UCD  will  be  only  those permitted by this Policy and subject to the appropriate governance approvals.
- (ii) Proof of counterparty powers: prior to entering into any treasury transaction with a counterparty, other than the approved counterparties listed at 3.3, all reasonable steps will be taken to verify the powers of that counterparty to enter into such agreements and such evidence as may be required to do this will be sought  from  the  counterparty,  with  additional  independent  specialist  advice where required.
- (iii) State and Political Risks: A number of elements of UCD's finances are impacted directly and indirectly by the policies and decisions of central government. Such risks will be taken into account, as far as this is possible, in determining treasury management policy and risk management strategy.
- (iv) Professional Advice: Where specialist advice is required in relation to treasury transactions,  UCD  will  seek  appropriate  advice  from  specialist  providers  to assist in its decision making.
- UCD is also mindful of reputational risk to the University and will take due regard of the possible adverse impacts on the reputation of the University when engaging in its Treasury activities in accordance with this Policy.

## 3.7 Operational Risk Policy

- UCD defines Operational Risk as the risk that UCD fails to identify circumstances in  which  it  may  be  exposed  to  loss  through  error,  fraud,  corruption,  process failure or other eventualities in its treasury management activities and fails to

employ  suitable  systems  and  procedures  and  maintain  effective  contingency management arrangements to these ends.

- UCD will ensure that treasury operational risk is effectively managed through:
- (i) Treasury  Procedures:  UCD  will  maintain  a  comprehensive  set  of procedures covering all treasury dealing, administrative and reporting practices.
- (ii) Treasury  Policy  Limits:  individuals  tasked  with  managing  treasury activities will ensure that at all times compliance is maintained with treasury policy limits and that any instances of non-compliance are reported to the FRAMC in a Treasury Policy Exception Report.
- (iii) Documentation:  UCD  will  ensure  documentary  evidence  is  stored which contains an accurate and complete record of every treasury transaction  undertaken.  This  includes  banking  and  investment transaction statements, account statements, all borrowing agreements and all security arrangements. Documentation will be stored in line with UCD's internal practice. Transactions should be confirmed by a counterparty in writing/by email on the day of the dealing date.
- (iv) Delegated  Authorities:  UCD  will  ensure  all  treasury  activities  are undertaken in strict compliance with the delegated authorities set out in Schedule 3.11 to this treasury management policy.
- (v) Segregation of Duties: UCD will ensure that there is clear segregation between those charged with implementing treasury management policies  and  executing  transactions  with  counterparties  and  those responsible for transaction settlement, the execution and transmission of funds, the recording and administering of treasury management transactions and the audit and review of the treasury management function.
- (vi) Loan Administration: UCD will ensure compliance with covenants of all borrowing  arrangements  on  a  continuous  basis. UCD  will maintain, in addition to complete documentary records, a summary database of key contractual terms which cover:
- Financial Covenants (levels and calculation basis for interest cover, gearing, asset cover).
- Information Covenants (detailed information covenant requirements and calendar); and
- Other Material Restrictions (such as restrictions on disposals or on-lending to other group members and details of cross-default and similar provisions).
- (vii) Reconciliation: UCD will undertake, at least monthly, reconciliations of all account balances  (including  bank,  collateral,  and  charged  accounts)  and  loan  balances between internal accounting records and counterparty documents.

- (viii) Dealing Mandates: UCD will maintain up to date lists of authorised signatories and dealing  mandates  for  all  banking  facilities,  investment  accounts  and  borrowing arrangements. All treasury transactions with Approved Counterparties must be undertaken in compliance with current dealing mandates.
- (ix) Professional Advice: UCD recognises that treasury management can be a complex and high-risk business activity. UCD will seek independent professional advice in any  circumstances  where  UCD  does  not  possess  sufficient  skills  in-house  to undertake a particular operational treasury activity.
- (x) Treasury Contingency Planning: UCD will ensure there are detailed contingency plans in place for the treasury.
- (xi) Reporting:  Where  there  is  a  material  treasury  error,  operational  failure  or occurrence of fraud, details will be reported to the FRAMC.

## 3.8 Performance Measurement

- UCD will endeavour to achieve value for money in its treasury management activities through employing, inter alia, the following performance measurement techniques:
- (i) Bank Transactions and Charges: UCD will regularly review bank account structures and charges in order to identify where banking efficiencies might be achieved.
- (ii) Returns on Investment: UCD will continuously monitor the returns on cash and investment balances against market benchmark interest rates and interest rates available from alternative market counterparties to ensure that the rate of return on surplus funds is optimised, having regard to counterparty credit risk and the primary consideration of security of principal invested.
- (iii) Debt Portfolio Optimisation: UCD will periodically monitor borrowing conditions in the bank and institutional markets and compare this to terms and conditions of existing borrowing arrangements in order to identify whether existing arrangements continue to provide value for money or whether advantage might be taken of alternative methods of financing or debt restructuring opportunities.
- (iv) Treasury Management Performance: UCD will measure the performance of the treasury management function through the delivery to FRAMC of the bi-annual Treasury Reports which will include retrospective review of performance against Treasury objectives, analysis of performance against treasury management KPIs and treasury policy limits and details of covenant compliance.

## 3.9 Decision Making and Analysis

- When making treasury decisions UCD will ensure that:
- (i) all  decisions  will  be  subjected  to  the  proper  level  of  analysis  and  scrutiny  by appropriately skilled and experienced individuals;
- (ii) all decisions are taken in accordance with the specific limits and authorities set out in this Policy; and
- (iii) all decisions are properly recorded and minuted.

- UCD will maintain complete records of its decision-making processes in relation to treasury transactions in order to:
- (i) demonstrate retrospectively that an appropriate level of due diligence has been performed and any necessary safeguards have been considered;
- (ii) allow for the future assessment of the rationale behind decisions and effectiveness of those decisions; and
- (iii) demonstrate the legality of transactions if required.
- When  contemplating  any  treasury  transaction,  which  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt includes any new investment, deposit or borrowing arrangement transaction, UCD will give proper consideration to, inter alia, the following factors:
- Transaction terms and conditions in the context of current market practice
- Transaction pricing in the context of market conditions
- Comparative analysis versus alternative options
- The present value of costs and benefits
- Analysis of short term and long-term costs and benefits
- Legal validity, and regulatory compliance
- The effect on cash flows, the business plan, and risks to achieving the business plan, and financial covenants.
- Wider financial market conditions and the interest rate term structure
- Budgetary constraints
- Counterparty status, credit quality, and relationship
- Security requirement and arrangements
- Form of legal documentation
- Accounting treatment and risks (including the accounting treatment under future FRS 102 and US GAAP based standards)
- The Bursar will be responsible for ensuring that the outcome of treasury decisions is effectively  communicated  to  any  staff  member  of  UCD  who  may  be  involved  in implementing those decisions in accordance with delegated authorities.

- (i) Accounting  Implications  of  Treasury  Transactions: UCD  will  fully  consider  the accounting effect of any material treasury transactions undertaken, under both

existing Irish GAAP  (FRS102)  standards  and  anticipated future accounting standards.  UCD  will  consider  the  impact  of  accounting  treatment  on  lender covenants  (e.g.,  breakage  costs  impacting  interest  cover).  Specialist  accounting and/or legal advice to determine the impact on covenants will be taken wherever appropriate. Wherever possible, accounting treatment will be agreed in principle in advance of the transaction with external auditors.

- (ii) Treasury Accounting Information: UCD will ensure that treasury record keeping is accurate, complete, and sufficient to enable the extraction of all data required for the  production  of  published  financial  statements  and  the  notes  to  those statements, taking into account future data requirements under FRS102 standards.
- (iii) Structured/non-basic treasury transactions: UCD will not enter into complex or structured  borrowing  arrangements  or  hedging  transactions  without  specific approval from FRAMC.
- (iv) Internal  audit: The  treasury  function's  policies,  practices  and  systems  will  be subject to a complete internal audit in accordance with the agreed internal audit programme.

|  3 | March 2025 | Changes to Counterparty Limits table at category and individual counterparty level; specifying the limits in terms of the generic criteria rather than in terms of specific approved counterparties; Removing the short-term credit ratings requirement for counterparties, using just the long-term ratings; Standardising the basis of calculation as 'cash available for investment' where 'portfolio balance' had sometimes been used. Explicitly stating that 'Principal' rather than 'Principal + accrued interest' is to be used in comparing against limits. Splitting the table of Delegated Authorities/Responsibilities into 2 separate tables; adding the responsibilities of the Treasury Investment Group to the table, reflecting current practice; introducing an approval limit of €10m for the Director of Finance, clarifying approval limits of €50m for Bursar, €100m for President, above €100m for FRAMC. Updating 'Director of Financial Management' job title to 'Director of Finance'. Making reference to a single US Dollar account as required by US Department of Education more generic. Including reference to performing treasury activities in accordance with the Responsible Investment Policy when it is approved. | UCD Finance |
