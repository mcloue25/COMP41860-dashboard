Academic Council

## 1 Purpose

UCD recognises that for a variety of reasons a student may need to withdraw from their programme and the University. It further recognises that in some cases a student may, at a later date, apply for readmission to the programme. This procedure document is intended to:

- Provide students who are thinking of withdrawing from their studies with important information about what it means to withdraw, including where they can seek further support and  advice 1 .
- Support students and staff by clarifying the procedures for withdrawal and applying for readmission.

## 2 Definitions

## 2.1 Withdrawal

Withdrawal is where a student leaves their programme of study permanently and ends all activity associated  with  their  studies  before  they  have  completed  the  programme  for  which  they  are registered.  A student does not need permission to withdraw but must notify the appropriate Governing Board 2 in writing, using the official UCD Withdrawal form, of their intention to withdraw. Students should submit their completed forms, along with their student card to their College/School Office 3 .

1 There are a variety of support systems within UCD where a student may seek further advice and assistance. While the College/ School Office is the primary point of contact, an up-to-date list of UCD support systems can be accessed at www.ucd.ie/students/services/

2

Refers to the relevant governing board of the programme, i.e., Programme Board, Graduate Research Board and Graduate Taught Programme Board.

3 All notifications from students on undergraduate programmes are submitted to their College/School Office and notifications from students on graduate programmes are normally submitted to their School (typically via the SISWeb form).

Please note: Up to until the end of the CAO season, an undergraduate entrant may cancel acceptance with Admissions that will cancel registration. For further information, please contact UCD Admissions. Contact details can be found at www.ucd.ie/admissions

Up to 01 October, a graduate entrant may cancel acceptance and should inform their College/School Office.

Note: Students remain liable for fees up to the date on which they formally submit the withdrawal notification form to their College/School Office 4 .

## 2.2 Retrospective withdrawal

Retrospective withdrawal is not normally permitted. However, it may be granted by a Governing Board where it is satisfied that:

- a. The student has extenuating  circumstances,
- b. There is no other available solution for the student given their circumstances, and,
- c. The student has not been engaged in any programme  activity 5 .

## 3 Scope

This  withdrawal  procedure  document  only  applies  to  students  i.e.,  those  who  have  confirmed  their registration 6 . It relates to all undergraduate and graduate programmes offered by the University and is effective across the University. Students registered to programmes that are run collaboratively with other institutions should normally notify their home institution of their intention to withdraw.

## 4 Principles

## 4.1 Withdrawal from a programme and re-admission

## 4.1.1 Withdrawal notification

- 4.1.1.1  If  a  student  is  considering  withdrawing  from  their  programme  of  study,  they should first contact their College/School Office. Any concerns a student may have are normally addressed in the first instance by the College/School Office, who will also invite the student to meet with the Academic Programme Director (and, in the case of students on graduate research programmes, their Principal Supervisor) and Student Adviser.

Students  considering  withdrawing  are  advised  that  the  sooner  they  contact their College/School Office, the more options their Governing Board will have to support them.

4 Information on the fees' implications of withdrawing for all students can be found on the Fees section of the UCD Registry website at www.ucd.ie/students/fees/withdrawal/ and information on refunds can be accessed at www.ucd.ie/students/fees/refunds/refundspolicy/ Please note that a student's fees liability is in line with the official dates published on the Fees website (www.ucd.ie/students/fees/feepaymentdeadlines/).

5 A retrospective withdrawal application is not a replacement for an extenuating circumstances application: where there has been student programme activity an extenuating circumstances application would seem most appropriate. Retrospective withdrawal is an additional option that may be considered by the Governing Board where circumstances warrant it.

6 Please note: Where someone has not confirmed their registration, they are not a student. Also, those who are attending their programme but do not confirm their registration within a defined period (normally the first eight weeks of the trimester/term) are liable for a late registration fine (see item 5.2 - deactivation of registration). For further information please see http://www.ucd.ie/students/fees/index.html. Students who have accepted a place via CAO and subsequently accept an offer elsewhere in a later round of CAO offers are automatically  withdrawn.

- 4.1.1.2  If  a  student  decides  to  withdraw  from  their  programme  of  study,  it  is  their responsibility  to  notify  the  University.  Notifications  must  be  made  on  the  official Withdrawal Form and should clearly  state a student's reason(s) for withdrawing.
- 4.1.1.3  Since  1  August  2016,  the  standard  withdrawal  form  can  be  accessed  and completed  via  SISWeb  by  selecting  Programme  Services  and  My  Leave  of Absence/Withdrawal Requests. Students should still return their student card to their College/School Office as appropriate. Students making an application for a retrospective  withdrawal  from  their  programme  are  still  required  to  complete  a paper form.
- 4.1.1.4  Standard programme withdrawal notifications, made via SISWeb, are communicated to Registry after your College/School Office has authorised them. Students will receive email confirming their submission and when this request has been processed on their record. Once processed, a withdrawal notification will be effective from the date submission. In the case of an application for retrospective withdrawal,  the  College/School  Office  notifies  UCD  Registry  of  the  Governing Board decision via existing delegated authority mechanisms along with instructions  relating  to  any  existing  academic  history  completed  by  the  student and sends the returned student card to the Student Record Team.
- 4.1.1.5  Withdrawal notifications are noted at the Governing Board.
- 4.1.1.6  Applications  for  retrospective  withdrawal  must  be  approved  by  the  Governing Board.

Note: Where a student does not formally notify the University that they are withdrawing, this may have a negative impact on their fee status, transcript, and re-admission applications.

- For example,  where  a  student does  not notify the University that they are withdrawing, their registration status will continue to show them as registered. This may lead to them receiving NG or ABS grades for modules they remain registered to, and to a standing of 'fees owing' with appropriate fees holds on their account.

## 4.2 Implications of withdrawing

## 4.2.1 Student status and registration

When a student notifies the University that they are withdrawing from their programme, their registration is terminated, and they are no longer a student of the University (effective from the date on which they formally submit the withdrawal notification form to their College/School Office).

## 4.2.2 Grants and payments under grants

If a student receives external funding, including grants, and they intend to withdraw from their programme,  they  should  consult  with  the  sponsoring/funding  agency  e.g.,  SUSI,  hospital, after they have spoken to their College/School Office.

- a. Continuous registration is a requirement of stipendiary scholarships as per the Revenue Commissioners. Normally this means that a student will not receive grant payments when they have  withdrawn.
- b. Where a student withdraws, they may be asked to return some, or all of the monies received under the grant scheme pertinent to  them.

## 4.2.3 Fees

Students  remain  liable  for  fees  up  to  the  date  on  which  they  submit  their  Withdrawal Notification Form to their College/School Office 7 - see 2.1 above, including footnote. If a

7 A student's fees liability is in line with the official dates published on the Fees website

student  would  like  specific  information  on  their  potential  withdrawal  fees  implications,  they should contact the UCD Student Desk 8 .

- a. Students should also be aware that they will not be re-admitted to the University where they are in bad financial standing with the University i.e., where they owe monies to UCD (see item 4.3.3 for additional information). The UCD debt carry-over facility of continuing undergraduate students applies to students seeking re-admission. The facility does not apply to  graduate  students  or  undergraduate  students  at  the  end  of  their  final  year  of studies. 9
- b. Students  who  are  resident  in  UCD  Residences  should  contact  the  residences  for information on the potential residences' fees implications of withdrawing. 10
- c. Students on undergraduate programmes who are withdrawing on medical grounds should refer to the 'Withdrawing from a programme' page on the Fees website at www.ucd.ie/students/fees/withdrawal/

## 4.2.4 Immigration issues

An international student with a residence permit from the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) is advised to consult with the International Student Adviser prior to withdrawing. The validity of a GNIB residence permit may be affected by college registration status.

## 4.2.5 Campus entitlements

Where a student has withdrawn from their programme of study, they are not entitled to use the  facilities  of  the  campus.  This  includes,  for  example,  health  services,  the  library,  UCD Residences and Brightspace.

## 4.3 Other options to consider:

## 4.3.1 Other options 1: Extenuating Circumstances

If a student is considering withdrawing due to extenuating circumstances they should refer to the  Policy  on  Extenuating  Circumstances  (students  on  undergraduate  and  graduate  taught programmes) or Policy on Theses in Graduate Research Programmes (students on graduate research programmes).

## 4.3.2 Other options 2: Leave of Absence

If  a  student needs to take a specified period of time off from their programme, they should refer to the Leave of Absence Academic Policy 11 for further information.

What is the difference between withdrawing and taking a leave of absence?

- Where a student who has withdrawn from their programme wishes, at a later date, to return to that programme, they must apply to be re-admitted.
- Where a student has taken a leave of absence from their programme, they have the right  to  resume  their  studies  at  the  end  of  the  approved  leave  of  absence  period (subject to the University's Rules, Regulations, codes  and  policies, and the programme regulations and structure in place at the time of their re-registration).

## 4.3.3 Other options 3: Financial assistance

If a student is considering withdrawing due to financial difficulties or hardship, they should contact their Student Adviser to see if they are eligible for financial  assistance. 12 Students may also contact the Students' Union Welfare Officer for information on financial assistance. 13 However, the Student Welfare Fund and Student Assistance Fund cannot be used for tuition fees and cannot be used by someone who is not a registered student.

## 4.3.4 Other options 4: First year withdrawal (deferral)

Undergraduate programmes:

- Students admitted through the CAO should contact UCD Admissions (www.ucd.ie/askus) or refer to www.ucd.ie/registry/prospectivestudents/admissions/policiesandgeneralregulation s/deferralprocedurescaoapplicants/ if they wish to defer their place.
- Students admitted through a route other than CAO should contact the office from which the offer issued if they wish to defer their place.

Graduate programmes:

- Applicants to UCD graduate programmes who wish to defer a place they have been offered should refer to

www.ucd.ie/registry/prospectivestudents/admissions/graduateapplicants/acceptinganoffer /deferringanoffer/

## 4.4 Re-admission

A student who has withdrawn from their programme of study can apply to the University for readmission to the programme. Undergraduate readmission is managed via the CAO and Graduate Taught readmission should be processed via the UCD online applications system. Graduate Research students should contact their School if they wish to discuss a possible return to their programme before submitting an application.

- 4.4.1 If  a student wishes to be re-admitted to a programme they previously withdrew from,  they  should  contact  the  College/School  Office  in  the  first  instance  for advice on the application procedure. Applications for undergraduate readmission at the start of Stage 1 must normally be made through the  CAO.
- 4.4.2 A  student  who  has  withdrawn  and  wishes  to  seek  admission  to  a  different programme in UCD should contact Admissions, UCD Registry (for undergraduate programmes) or the relevant College/School Office (for graduate programmes).
- 4.4.3 UCD Admissions sends the re-admission application to the relevant Governing Board/Admissions Tutor for approval as  required.
- 4.4.4 Governing  Board/Admissions  Tutor  decisions  to  re-admit  Graduate  Research students  are  communicated  to  UCD  Registry  via  existing  delegated  authority mechanisms  (InfoHub  Tasks),  and  UCD  Registry  amends  the  student  record accordingly.  Applicants  will  normally  be  informed  of  the  outcome  of  their application  by  UCD  Admissions  or  by  the  relevant  College/School  Office.  All other students must re-apply through Online Applications.

Credit previously earned will be reviewed and applied to the programme of study when a student returns provided that the learning outcomes are still relevant.

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

As per section 5.12 of Academic Regulations, a Governing Board may allow a returning student to repeat modules that the student had previously passed, failed, or both, during their previous period of registration as equivalent to first attempts upon their subsequent registration where certain criteria are met.

A student who is re-admitted to a programme is governed by the University's Rules, Regulations, codes and policies, and the programme regulations and structure in place at the time of their readmission.

## 5 Additional information: confirmation of registration status and  deactivation

## 5.1 Confirmation of registration status

The University reserves the right to amend a student's registration if it determines that the registration  is  not  reflecting  the  student's  situation.  The  relevant  programme  determines whether  the  student  record  should  be  amended.  This  decision  will  be  based  on  local information and information provided by Registry.

## 5.2 Deactivation of registration (including reactivation)

A student who does not confirm their registration at the start of the academic session has their registration deactivated after week 8 of their first trimester. Registration can only be reactivated during that trimester where the student informs the UCD Student Desk and pays the late registration f ee 14 .

Normally, if a student wishes to resume their programme at any point after that they must formally  apply  to  their  Governing  Board  for  re-admission  as  per  existing  procedures  (see sub-section 4.4 above) and by the established submission dates. 15
