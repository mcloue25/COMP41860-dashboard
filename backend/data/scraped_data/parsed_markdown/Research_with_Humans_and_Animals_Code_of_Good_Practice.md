Approval date and body

UMT, 4 th  November 2025

## 1.  Purpose

The purpose of this code is to collate all of the UCD policies and procedures that govern the research process and provide guidance for the responsible conduct of research for all members of the UCD Community  who  are  engaged  in  research  with  humans  and  animals.  In  addition,  this  code  also references external regulations that apply to research with humans and animals.

## 2.  Definitions

- Research Ethics: Research Ethics can be defined as the 'morally right thing to do' and, in the context of research ethics, this involves the protection of humans and animals in research. It is an internationally recognised process that ensures researchers engage in good practice for research involving  humans  and  animals.  Research  ethics  embodies  internationally  accepted  principles (norms),  regulations  (laws  and  codes)  and  responsible  practices  researchers  must  abide  by  in conducting scientific research.

## ● UCD Community means:

- o all UCD employees, whether part time or full time, permanent or temporary;
- o all employees of UCD's wholly owned subsidiary companies or overseas campus/offices;
- o all registered students of UCD;
- o non-University employees who use University funds, facilities or other resources, including the University's name and reputation, to carry out teaching and/or research, and/or participate in UCD-administered  research,  including  retired  employees,  visiting  faculty  and  researchers; consultants,  contractors,  affiliated  hospital  staff,  industrial  personnel  and  research  fellows, regardless of obligations to other companies or institutions; and
- o all persons conducting teaching and/or research at or under the auspices of UCD including at any  of  UCD's  overseas  campus,  including  visiting  faculty  and  researchers;  consultants; contractors, Emeritus or adjunct appointments; and research fellows.
- Research Ethics Committee (REC) promotes the ethical use of human and animal subjects in research throughout UCD. The REC oversees and advises on policy regarding the work carried out by the sub-committees (see below). The REC facilitates and promotes research in UCD based on internationally accepted ethical norms and best practice and with attention to the welfare of study subjects and participants.
- The Office of Research Ethics (ORE) is the secretariat to the REC and manages the activities of the reviewing sub-committees and operates and develops the research ethics application process.

- The sub-committees of the REC review submitted research ethics applications and includes the Animal Research Ethics Committee (AREC), the Human Research Ethics Committee - Sciences (HREC-LS), and Human Research Ethics Committee - Humanities (HREC-HS).
- Local  School-level  Taught  Masters  Research  Ethics  committees  (TMREC)  and  Undergraduate Research Ethics committees (UREC) review submissions at a local level for their taught masters or undergraduate students engaged in human data collection, and report to the relevant HREC (LS or HS).
- The approvals system is the process through which all submissions to the Office of Research Ethics (ORE) for ethical review, and all reviews, decisions and approvals are carried out on behalf of the university.
- Ethical reviews refer to applications submitted by members of the UCD Community for either full ethical review or low-risk application review (or exemption from full review in the case of research using animals) to a sub-committee of the REC.
- Protection means protection of humans, animals, and members of the UCD Community from risk or harm, and protection of the university from reputational damage.
- Medical devices are products or equipment intended for a medical purpose. They must undergo a conformity assessment to demonstrate they meet legal requirements to ensure they are safe and perform  as  intended  under  medical  device  regulations.  Ethical  approval  for  research  involving clinical medical devices is provided by the National Research Ethics Committee (NREC).
- Medical devices include 'wearables' (although not all wearables require medical device registration with HPRA). Use of wearable devices for research must comply with GDPR requirements regarding data  privacy,  data  collection  and  storage,  security,  and  informed  consent  and  with  ePrivacy regulations.
- Clinical trials are scientifically controlled studies undertaken in humans to establish or confirm the safety  and  effectiveness  of  investigational  medicinal  products  (IMPs).  Clinical  trials  may  be registered  clinical  trials  (RCTs  -  these  require  approval  by  the  NREC),  or  observational  clinical studies (OCS). Approval for OCS is through the relevant hospital REC. Retention of data for RCTs is 25 years, but only around 15 years for OCS's.
- Biological samples are any type of biological material derived from a living organism that can be studied and analysed in a laboratory.
- Biobanks are curated collections consisting of biological samples and associated data.

## 3.  Underlying policies

All  members  of  the  UCD  Community  should  be  familiar  with  and  adhere  to  the  UCD  policies  and procedures that govern the research process, as well as the other institutional policies of the University. These policies are collated in the two codes below (3.1 and 3.2) and the most recent versions can be accessed from the UCD Governance Document Library.

## 3.1 Code of Responsible Conduct of Research

The Code of Responsible Conduct of Research collates the UCD policies and procedures governing the research process and which collectively support an environment of responsible conduct of research. This includes the Research Integrity Policy, Research Data Management, Policy for Supervision of Research Degree Students, Funded Research Activity Policy, Intellectual Property Policy, Conflict of Interest Policy, Authorship Policy, Consultancy and External Work Policy and the Performance for Growth Policy.

The management of Research Data is detailed in the following policies and legislation:

- UCD Research Data Management Policy - Collecting, recording, securing, storing and archiving/deleting research data.
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (2016) -Processing of personal data.
- Data Protection Act 2018 (Section 36(2)) (Health Research) Regulations 2018, as amended. -Processing of personal data for health research purposes.
- Living  Guidelines  on  the  Responsible  use  of  Generative  AI  in  Research  (European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation -March 2024 - Full document)

## 3.2 Employee Code of Conduct

The Employee Code of Conduct Policy collates the UCD policies and procedures governing employee conduct to ensure that all employees are familiar with and can adhere to UCD policies and procedures that are relevant to required standards of conduct. This includes, in addition to those outlined in the Code of Responsible Conduct in Research, Anti-Fraud and Corruption Policy, Data Protection Policy, Dignity and Respect Policy and Procedure, Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Policy, Hospitality and Entertainment Policy, Information Technology Services Acceptable Use Policy and Policy on Health and Safety Management.

## Guidance from professional bodies

It is the responsibility of the researcher to fully abide by the codes of ethics and standards of professional conduct  relevant  to  their  profession  and  any  other  existing  guidance  issued  by  their  respective regulatory or professional bodies.

## 4.  Responsible Conduct of Research with Humans and Animals

All  research  that  involves  either  human  or  animal  subjects  carried  out  by  members  of  the  UCD Community requires either full ethical  review  or  an  exemption  from  full  ethical  review.  This  can  be obtained by submitting an application  for  full  review  or  low  risk  review  (exemption  from  full  ethical review) to the relevant UCD research ethics committee. The University's Research Ethics Policy and associated Committee guidelines provide detailed guidance on this matter. The Policy is applicable to all members of the UCD Community and should be read in tandem with this document and the Policy on the Use of Animals for Teaching and Research.

## 4.1 Research Involving Human Participants or Biological Samples

Ethical approval is required for all research involving human participants or biological samples from the appropriate University and/or Hospital Research Ethics Committees and/or from other regulatory bodies or  local  research  ethics  committees  as  relevant,  and  as  required  by  individual  sponsors  or  funding agencies.  Members  of  the  UCD  Community  should  also  ensure  informed  consent  is  sought,  and confidentiality of personal information relating to the participants in their research considered. Members of the UCD Community need to be mindful that their research fulfils any legal requirements applicable such as those of the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2018, and the Freedom of Information Act 2014, as may be amended or revised.

- External ethics committees: Where research subjects are being accessed through a hospital or other similar clinical setting and where that institution has an ethics committee, it will normally be for that body (and not the relevant UCD Ethics Review Committee) that reviews the application and gives or withholds ethical approval for the study.

## 4.2 Using Animals for Research or Teaching Purposes

Ethical approval is required for all activity involving the use of animals for research or teaching purposes from the Animal Research Ethics Committee (AREC). The research or teaching activity

must also comply with all statutory authorisation requirements of the Health Products Regulatory Authority  (HPRA) under SI  543 of 2013 European Union (Protection of Animals used for Scientific Purposes)  Regulations  (2012).  The  university  actively  supports  the  implementation  of  the  3Rs -replacement,  reduction  and  refinement  (Russell  &amp;  Burch,  1959)  on  which  much  of  the  legislation controlling the use of animals for research is based.

## 4.3 Low-Risk Ethical Review / Exemption from Full Review

A low-risk ethical review is required for all research involving human or animal subjects that meets the specific criteria for low-risk review (HREC) or exemption from full review (AREC). Members of the UCD Community  have  the  responsibility  to  ensure  that  they  have  fully  reviewed  the  REC  policies  and associated guidelines before self-certifying that their work qualifies as low-risk.

## 5. Legal Obligations

Members of the UCD Community are responsible for their own research and are therefore required to be aware of and comply with all applicable legal requirements and specifically required to be aware of the following:

5.1 The University's Research Ethics Approval System, which involves submitting and reviewing applications to the relevant UCD ethics committee, is an internal process. This system alone does not fulfil Irish or European legal requirements if additional statutory approvals are required. Members of the UCD Community must ensure that research fulfils any legal requirements such as those of the General Data  Protection  Regulations  (GDPR) ,  the Data  Protection  Act  (2018),  including the Irish  Health Research Regulations , Section 36 (2), and the Freedom of Information Act (2014 ), as may be amended;

5.2 Members of the UCD Community are expected to be aware of, and comply with, all relevant laws and regulations at the local research site. The Office of Human Research Protections (in the U.S Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services)  has  curated  an International  Compilation  of  Human Research Standards which should be consulted;

5.3 Since the 1 st  of January 2013,  the Health Products Regulatory Authority  (HPRA) under the Directive 2010/63/EU, became responsible for statutory oversight of all research and teaching projects involving procedures on protected animals in Ireland;

5.4 Human rights are protected by the Constitution of Ireland and the European Convention on Human Rights which has been bolstered in Irish domestic law by the European Convention on Human Rights Act, 2003 (as may be amended);

5.5 Under the Clinical Trials Regulations 2024 (EU Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use,  SU  3/2024), all  research  involving  clinical  trials  must  be  authorised  by  HPRA  for  scientific assessment and submitted to the National Research Ethics Committee (NREC) for ethical review;

5.6 Under SI 671/2023 EU (National Research Ethics Committees for Clinical Investigations of Medical Devices) Regulations, 2023, all research involving investigation of medical devices must also be  authorised  by  HPRA  for  scientific  assessment  and  submitted  to  the  NREC  for  ethical  review. Members  of  the  UCD  Community  should  consult  the Guide  for  Ethics  Committees  on  Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices (2024);

5.7 Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research is regulated in Ireland since the passing of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act of 2024. Ethical compliance of the institution where the cell line is derived must be in accordance with the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Guidelines , (2021, 2 nd  Edn. or as may be updated). Separate guidance on the use of both hESC and

induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) is being prepared and will be available on the UCD Research Ethics website. This guidance will continue to be updated as new developments in the area emerge;

5.8 A biobank may be defined as a repository of biological samples, either human or animal. In recognition of the heterogeneity of what might be considered a biobank, separate guidance on the creation, maintenance and use of biobank material is available via the UCD Research Ethics website.
