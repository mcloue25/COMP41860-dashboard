## Aegrotat and Posthumous Awards Guidelines

The Aegrotat and Posthumous Awards guidelines are intended to outline the award of a degree in the event of (a) the death of a student prior to the completion of their degree (posthumous degree) or (b) a student being prevented from completing their degree due to a diagnosis of terminal or debilitating illness (aegrotat degree). These guidelines also outline  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  individuals  involved  in  the  process. These guidelines are applicable to both taught and research students of University College Dublin; distinct differences will be highlighted.

## 1. Definitions

- A posthumous award is an award, without classification, that may be awarded  on the death of a student where there is sufficient evidence based on the student's performance that the student would have qualified for the award.
- An aegrotat award is an award, without classification, that may be awarded if a student is prevented from completing  their  studies  by  illness  or  other  special  circumstances  where  there  is  evidence  based  on  the student's work that the student would have qualified for the award had they been able to continue.

## 2. Principles

## Posthumous award

A posthumous award, is an award, without classification, that may be awarded at any stage during a taught programme, once there is sufficient evidence based on the student's performance that the student would have qualified for the award.

A posthumous award of a research degree can be awarded at one of two stages of  programme:

1. After submission of thesis: the thesis can be examined as normal (without viva)
2. Before submission of the thesis: the supervisor/s must consider whether there is a sufficient quantity of material to represent the thesis. The supervisor/s must be satisfied that there is enough to permit an academic judgement to be made.

The student's supervisor may be invited to provide supplementary and/or explanatory material to assist in the work of the examination committee.

In the interests of courtesy and sensitivity, a posthumous award should only be made with the knowledge and consent of the next of kin and/or immediate family members.

## Aegrotat award

An aegrotat  award is  an  award,  without  classification,  that  may  be  awarded  if  a  student  is  prevented  from completing their  studies  by  illness  or  other  special  circumstances where there is evidence based on the student's performance that the student would have qualified for the award had they been able to continue.

The aegrotat award will be considered once the student's registration in their taught programme has been updated to a withdrawn status. If the student agrees to accept the aegrotat award, they will agree to waive the right to any further assessment/reassessment.

An aegrotat award of a research degree can be awarded at either of two stages of the programme:

1. After submission of thesis: the thesis can be examined as normal (without viva)
2. Before submission of the thesis: the supervisor/s must consider whether there is a sufficient quantity of material to represent the thesis. The supervisor/s must be satisfied that there is enough to permit an academic judgement to be made.

The student's supervisor may be invited to provide supplementary and/or explanatory material to assist in the work of the examination committee.

Aegrotat awards do not confer the entitlements which might otherwise be associated with the programme of study concerned, these could include any rights to practice, to register with a professional body or to gain exemptions from professional body requirements.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

Programme  Director/Programme  Dean/Supervisor :  The  Programme Director/Programme Dean/Supervisor in which  the  student  was/is  registered  is  responsible  for  initiating  the  process  for  the  approval  of  a  posthumous  or aegrotat  award  respectively  They  (or  their  nominee)  are  also  responsible  for  liaising  with  the  next  of  kin/family member of the student.

Governing  Board: The  Governing  Board  should  take  account  of  the  candidate's  performance  and  other  relevant evidence  which  would  demonstrate  that,  had  the  student  completed  the  assessments,  they  would  clearly  have reached a standard for the award of a degree. If agreed, the recommendation is to be submitted to ACCE for final approval.

ACCE: ACCE will, on behalf of the university, review and may approve the request for award and notify the nominator and Conferring Unit of the outcome.

Conferring Unit: Is responsible for the amendment of the student's record and for liaising with the Governing Board on a conferral date.

In the case of a posthumous award, or where an aegrotat awardee is unable to attend graduation, a family member may attend the ceremony to receive the award on their behalf.  Alternatively, the degree award may be presented as part of a private meeting by a representative of the university, or sent by post, if this is the wish of the next of kin.

## 4. Procedure

In  order  to  submit  an  application  for  an  aegrotat  or  posthumous  award  to  the  ACCE an Aegrotat and Posthumous Form will need to be completed and emailed to ACCE@ucd.ie

If  approved,  the  ACCE  will  contact  the  relevant  staff  member  to  confirm  the  award  and  will  liaise  with  the  UCD Conferring Unit to inform them of the approved award.
