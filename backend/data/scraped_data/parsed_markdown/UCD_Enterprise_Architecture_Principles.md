## 1. Introduction

The  UCD  Enterprise  Architecture  Principles define the underlying rules and guidelines for how  we  select,  design,  &amp;  deploy  applications  across  the  University.  These  principles  are intended  to  reduce  the  complexity  of  digital  investment  decisions  in  support  of  the University's strategic ambition.

For  all  applications  that  support  or  enable  UCD's  business  capabilities  or  are  intended  to carry  the  UCD  name  and  branding  with  reputational  standing,  investment  decisions  and business cases are strengthened by alignment with these principles.

These  principles  are  supported  by  a  detailed  set  of  Non-functional  requirements  (which outline Performance and Availability, System Integration and Interoperability, IT Security and Data Controls, and  Service  Management  &amp;  Support  requirements)  which  should  be incorporated into the design , procurement, evaluation, and implementation of applications.

These principles and the non-functional requirements:

- provide a standardised and consistent approach to deploying IT solutions
- will  be  used  to  guide  decision-making,  to  evaluate  and  prioritise  investments  on applications centrally
- will be used inform design and development of applications
- should be included in a Request For Proposal (RFP) and procurement processes

## 3. Enterprise Architecture Principles - Details

This  section  outlines the Statement, Rationale and Implications of each of the principles to assist in applying them in UCD's environment.

## Business Principles

## 1. Optimise Benefit to the University

## Statement

- Decisions  are made with a people-centric approach and the intention of achieving optimum benefit to the University as a whole

## Rationale

- Decisions  made  from  a  University-wide  perspective  and  a  strategic  'big  picture' viewpoint and will drive long-term value across the University
- Recognise  that  perfection  is  not  always  necessary.  Strive  for  services  that  meet essential requirements without unnecessary features. Prioritise value over perfection

## Implications

- Governance  structures  will  be  established  to  ensure  that  any  conflicts  between immediate local interests and long-term University-wide goals can be addressed in a fair and transparent manner
- Investment priorities should be established for the entire University
- The Digital Roadmap sets the overarching   direction for IT enabled investments. All applications deployed should align to UCDs Digital Roadmap, which sets the direction for future use of applications within UCD's digital campus

## 2. Comply with Statutory and Regulatory Obligations

## Statement

- UCD  must  comply  with  all  relevant  internal  and  external  laws,  policies,  statutory obligations, and regulations

<!-- image -->

## UCD Enterprise Architecture Principles

Owner:

IT Services

## Rationale

- The  University  must  be  mindful  to  comply  with  laws,  regulations,  and  external policies, ensuring they are identified as key prioritised requirements

## Implications

- Applications  must  comply  with  local  laws  and  regulations  regarding  data  privacy, security, and accessibility
- Favour applications that are easily adaptable when  statutory and  regulatory obligations alter
- Changes in the law and changes in regulations may drive changes in our applications
- The procurement of all applications must adhere to UCD procurement policies and public  procurement regulations and contractual obligations. See UCD Procurement and Contracts Office
- All Applications used to store and process University, personal, and/or sensitive data must comply with GDPR and legal obligations.  See UCD Office of the DPO, and UCD Legal Office

## 3. Common Tools for Common Purposes

## Statement

- Standardised  university-wide  applications  are  preferred  over  similar  or duplicative departmental applications

## Rationale

- Reuse  of  common  applications  leads  to  a  consistent  and  coherent experience for users  and  a  simpler  learning,  familiarisation  effort  for  everyone,  and  streamlines accurate data

## Implications

- Units and Schools will not be allowed to develop applications for their own use which are similar or duplicative of University-wide applications
- Where  a  similar  or  duplicative  solution  is  requested,  this  must  be  supported  by  a justification.   This  may be around a justifiable functional uniqueness or regulatory

IT Services requirement

- Schools/units should engage with IT Services to evaluate whether existing applications  within  the  University  can  meet  their  needs,  recognising  that  a  non perfect fit solution may be good enough
- Applications should be catalogued in such a fashion that makes it easier to determine their reusability
- Units  and  Schools  which  depend  on  applications  which  do  not  serve  the  entire University must change over to the replacement University-wide solutions. This will require establishment of and adherence to a policy requiring this
- Data and information used to support University decision-making will be standardised  to  a  much  greater  extent  because  departmental  applications  which produce data which is not shared among other Schools and Units will be replaced by University-wide  solutions  where  the  data  produced  can  be  shared  across  the University

## 4. Business Continuity by Design

## Statement

- Business operations need to be maintained in spite of interruptions

## Rationale

- Business  areas  throughout  the  organisation  must  be  able  to  continue  conducting their normal activities, regardless of external events - whether it's a natural disaster, man-made or wilful damage such as a cyberattack or power failure

## Implications

- Business areas must determine the level of availability and recovery objectives that they  need to ensure adequate business continuity, to be included in requirements and addressed at the time of the design
- Dependencies on other applications and/or shared underlying technical components should be assessed during design
- Applications should be assessed for criticality and dependencies, in order to  inform disaster recovery planning
- Business Continuity plans should be developed and tested by the business
- Applications should  have  availability  and  security  monitoring,  with  automated alerting for breaches

## 5. Strategic Partnerships and Sourcing

## Statement

- Strong relationships with strategic partners and vendors, support and enable UCD's future growth

## Rationale

- Strategic partnerships create value through focussing multi-disciplinary resources on achieving shared objectives and outcomes
- By  leveraging  external  partners  and  vendors,  UCD  can  focus resources on what it does best and where the most benefit is derived
- Strategic  sourcing  can  reduce  costs  through  economies  of  scale,  better  contract management,  flexibility  to  scale  operations,  and  mitigate  risks  associated  with technology obsolescence and vendor lock-in

## Implications

- Develop relationships with strategic partners which can provide broad services across the University
- Robust vendor management is needed to evaluate, onboard, and manage partnerships effectively, including performance metrics, SLAs, and risk assessments
- The enterprise must invest in technology that supports smooth integration between internal systems and external platforms
- The Procurement Office should be engaged to ensure that the procurement process is adhered to for identifying and engaging with strategic partners
- Periodically  evaluate  alternative  strategic  suppliers  to  ensure  that  the  University doesn't become locked in or overly dependent on a single strategic supplier, and that they support of UCD's long-standing commitment to sustainability
- Evaluate vendors on their maturity, viability, ability and credibility
- Adherence  with  UCD  Procurement  Policy  / Guidelines is a requirement. Units and Schools should engage with UCD Procurement as early as possible, so that they can be guided on procurement thresholds, particular frameworks available, and timeline considerations
- The University is subject to EU and National Public Procurement legislation and all staff  with  responsibility  for  purchasing  should  be  familiar  with  UCDs  Procurement /Purchasing Unit procedures and quotation and tender compliance requirements.
- It  is  strongly  recommended that all software and cloud service purchases are made

using  Purchase  Orders  (PO)  as  they  include UCD's standard terms and conditions. Where this is not possible, and the unit/school is purchasing using a Credit Card, the unit/school  must  review  the  vendor  terms  of  use  to evaluate and accept the risk prior to purchase

## 6. Clear Ownership &amp; Sustainable Support

## Statement

- Application  ownership  requires  appropriate  authority  and  adequate  resources  for sustainable support

## Rationale

- Applications  need  to  be sustainably supported so that they can be relied upon by students, staff, researchers and faculty

## Implications

- Every  application  must  have  clearly  identified  and  agreed  Application  Business Owner  and  Application  Technical  Owner  in  place to ensure that the application is correctly designed, developed, and deployed
- Every  application  must  have  a  clearly  defined  and  agreed  Application  Business Manager and Application Technical Manager in place responsible for liaising with the Enterprise  Architecture  team  to provide accurate and complete information about the application
- Application Owners and Application Managers need to be aware of their roles and responsibilities, and empowered, so that they can perform them effectively

## Data Principles

## 7. Data is the Foundation of Decision Making

## Statement

- Users should have ready access to the information they need in carrying out their job

## Rationale

- Up-to-date and accurate information is a key input into decision making processes at all levels of the University - operational and strategic

## Implications

- Information needs to be timely, accurate and complete
- Access to information should be defined by the role(s) of the user
- Users should avoid creating separate replicas of data outside of master data systems where possible
- Where  the  same  data  is  stored  across  multiple  applications,  data  replication relationships should be clearly defined and approved
- Access  to  data  does  not  constitute  understanding  of  the  data.  Caution should be taken not to misinterpret information.  Users should be informed by business owners where and how to access information required to complete their business activities
- Interfaces  should  be  designed  to  mitigate  impact  to the University when changes occur
- Confidentiality  measures  must  be  used  to  ensure  that  sensitive  information  is accessible only to authorised individuals or systems
- Integrity  measures  must  be  used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data by preventing unauthorised alterations or modifications
- Availability measures must be used to ensure that data is accessible and usable when needed by authorised users
- IT  Services  must  be  consulted  at  the  evaluation  stage  where  data  integration  with another system is required

## 8. Data Protection by Design

## Statement

- Data must be protected from unauthorised use and disclosure

## Rationale

- Data is a valuable corporate resource; it has real measurable value
- Unauthorised  disclosure  of  personal  or  confidential  University  data  can  have  a significant legal, financial and reputational consequence for the University, including fines
- Data  Protection by Design &amp; Default is a GDPR concept (Article 25) and mandates integrating  data  protection  measures  into  systems  and  processes from the outset and ensuring only necessary personal data is processed by default

## Implications

- Privacy  and  security  of  data  is  everyone's  responsibility  and  it  is  important  for building trust
- UCD data must be classified, and stored &amp; processed appropriately
- Confidentiality measures must ensure that data is kept secret and only accessible to authorised users by protecting data  from  unauthorised  access,  disclosure,  or exposure
- Applications  should  include  an  exit  strategy  for  disengaging  from  the  vendor  or service,  allowing  UCD data to be recovered from the vendor and having an agreed retention schedule for any data stored
- Where personal or sensitive data is being recorded or processed, it is recommended that  a  security  partner  be  engaged  to  undertake  an external security review of the proposed application
- All Applications used to store and process University, personal, and/or sensitive data must comply with GDPR and legal obligations.  See UCD Office of the DPO, and UCD Legal Office
- The deployment  of  applications for research projects  must  comply  with  the University's Research Data Management Policy

## Application Principles

## 9. Universal Design and Global Reach

## Statement

- Universal Design ensures systems  are  inclusive,  accessible,  and  usable  by  all individuals

## Rationale

- Universal Design supports UCD's people-centric approach to service delivery
- UCD is competing globally to attract students, researchers, faculty and staff
- Universal Design fosters inclusivity, enhances user experience, meets legal accessibility standards, and drives innovation by accommodating diverse needs from the start, ultimately improving organisational efficiency and social responsibility
- Internationalisation  requires  consideration  of  diverse  cultural  contexts,  languages, and regulatory requirements

## Implications

- Promote  Universal  Design  Standards  for  accessibility,  consistency  and  ease-of-use through the end user experience
- Accessibility  testing  is  carried  out  according  to agreed standards in order to ensure an optimal user experience for users with accessibility needs
- User  interfaces  should  be  responsive  to  device  formats  and  adopt  the  latest standards whilst maintaining backwards compatibility with supported systems
- Users should have access to self-serve options where appropriate
- All  Applications  must  support accessibility standards, to ensure all users are able to perceive, understand, navigate and interact with our services. See UCD Accessibility
- Applications should be designed with internationalisation in mind from the outset, to ensure a consistent user experience across different languages and regions
- Applications should be ready for localisation without requiring significant redesign, redevelopment,  or  performance  degradation.  This  includes  support  for  multiple character  sets,  languages  (including  right-to-left),  date  formats,  currency  formats, and cultural conventions
- Applications  should provide mechanisms for easy content translation and updates, including  dynamic  content,  and  user  interface  elements  should  be  designed  to

accommodate varying lengths of text and different alphabets

- There are specific technical challenges related to providing access to applications and technologies to some overseas campuses (such as the China Joint Colleges Office), including  but  not  limited  to  data  security,  internet  restrictions,  and  regulatory requirements.  This  may  require setting up localised infrastructure (application and technologies) to ensure compliance with national laws
- The Irish Language Act 2021 increases the obligations on UCD to promote the use of the Irish language for official purposes

## 10. Automated Provisioning &amp; Role Based Access

## Statement

- Users should be automatically provisioned with access to the services  and applications  needed  to  do  their  job,  based  on  their  role  within  the  university, eliminating the need to request it

## Rationale

- Provisioning access to standardised and high-volume services and applications based on established University roles simplifies the onboarding experience and allows them to get started quicker
- Reduces data protection risks - as users move roles their access changes to reflect this
- Reduces user support therefore improves user experience
- Self-service  on-request  access  should  be  provided  where  access requirements are specific to individuals

## Implications

- Providing  users  with seamless access to applications automatically encourages the use of existing available applications and technologies
- Access to applications and data should be role based, based on a person's record
- Application-level roles should be mapped to organisational roles where possible
- Users  should have a single identity related to their capacity within the University (e.g. staff, student) which is maintained throughout their lifecycle with the University in the central Identity Management system

IT Services

- Automated  provisioning  is  best  suited  for  repetitive,  high-volume  requests  that benefit from consistency and predefined rules
- Applying automation to all services can introduce rigidity or inefficiencies in handling unique needs
- Self-service  enhances  user  satisfaction  and  agility  by  allowing  on-demand  access while still ensuring compliance with established governance policies.
- Services enabled for self-service must be designed with user-friendly interfaces and clear guidance to ensure effective adoption
- Appropriate  governance  and  controls  must  be  implemented  to prevent misuse or misconfiguration
- Ensure  alignment with security and compliance standards through access controls, role-based authorisations, and audit trails

## 11. Buy before Build

## Statement

- Consider  packaged  solutions  before  custom-build  applications  and  configuration before customisation 1 .

## Rationale

- Packaged applications come with built in processes that are typically well tested and based on market standards
- Building  customisation  and  bespoke  applications  requires  functional and technical expertise,  often  relying  on  niche  skills  that  are  in  short  supply.  They  can  also introduce deployment,  technical performance, and data privacy and security risks.
- There may be exceptional cases to justify a customisation or bespoke development where critical business or technical capabilities cannot be met with configuration of a packaged solution.

1 Configuration refers to tailoring of an application using built-in tools without alteration of the underlying code.  Customisation refers to modifications or extensions to the application's underlying source code.

## UCD Enterprise Architecture Principles

Owner:

IT Services

## Implications

- A  detailed  analysis  of  options  should  be  considered  including  the  availability  of packaged solutions, the business requirements and the cost of each option
- When  procuring  and  implementing  new  solutions,  consider  whether  the  solution supports a person-centric approach  and  consider  whether  university  business processes can be amended to simplify implementation, or where requirements exist that  require tailoring in some form to deliver - the application should be configured rather than customised
- The justification and cost/benefit analysis for customisations or bespoke development  should  take  into  account  the  cost  and  resource  implications for the implementation and ongoing support.

## 12. Cloud First

## Statement

- Consider cloud services before selecting or implementing on premise alternatives

## Rationale

- Rapid deployment of cloud resources allows the University to work in a more agile manner
- Cloud  solutions  may  be  designed  to be highly durable and spread across multiple geographic locations to reduce availability risks

## Implications

- Utilise  cloud  services  and  infrastructure  that  support  auto-scaling  and  on-demand resource allocation
- Consider 'subscription' over purchasing where possible and practical
- Cloud  solutions  providers  and  hosting  providers  must  adhere  to  international security standards, such as ISO27001 and SOC2
- Develop an exit strategy before adopting Cloud solutions to avoid vendor lock-in
- Prioritise  Software-as-a-Service  (SaaS)  services,  over  Platform-as-a-Service  (PaaS), over  Infrastructure-as-a-Service  (IaaS),  over  on  premise  when  evaluating  hosting options

## Technology Principles

## 13. Control Technical Diversity

## Statement

- Technology diversity is managed,  to  minimise  the additional  effort  and  cost associated with implementing and maintaining disparate solutions

## Rationale

- Embrace industry standards
- Standardise to reduce needless diversity

## Implications

- Existing technologies should be considered before new technologies are introduced
- Governance processes, supported by appropriate resources and tools should be put in place to control technical diversity
- We should be cognisant of technology advances, and adopt where benefits can be demonstrated

## 14. Responsive, Requirements based Change Management

## Statement

- Decisions around implementing applications must meet clearly defined and agreed requirements supporting a person-centric approach.

## Rationale

- Ensure that applications must adequately support both functional and non-functional requirements

## Implications

- Digital  transformation of the University is achieved through a coordinated approach across the University

- Changes, such as the introduction or removal of applications, should be supported by a clear and transparent decision-making process with due diligence and risk oversight
- All  applications  should  go  through  a  review  process  before  they  are  shared  with other schools/units, or used to support University-wide business processes
- Where an application requires IT Services assistance in the design, deployment, or operation, it must be submitted as an IT Project. See Request an IT Project for further details  on  the  IT  projects  planning  process.   The  planning  and  prioritisation of IT Projects is governed by the UMT Digital Campus Group
- UCD  has  adopted PM 2 as  its  recommended Project Management Methodology, so that, at an enterprise level, we have a defined, consistent way of working on projects
- Changes  should  follow  examination  of  the impact on   the enterprise architecture. Where  changes  to  the architecture are going to be made,  the  architecture documentation should be kept updated
- The University must continually invest in necessary resourcing for the evolution of applications to ensure that the fit is maintained
- Evolving technologies will be monitored for acceptable use
- All  Applications  must  be  registered before acquisition, and the registration updated before rollout, and at decommissioning. See Application Registration process

## 15. Scalable and Extensible Architecture

## Statement

- Balance  long-term  capacity  and  capability  needs  with  cost  effective  and  scalable, flexible, and extensible architectures

## Rationale

- To  maintain  competitiveness  and  operational  efficiency,  the  University's  digital campus must accommodate growth, adapt to evolving technologies, and seamlessly integrate new functionalities

## Implications

- Applications  should be designed to be scalable, flexible, and extensible to support current and future business needs, ensuring that it can efficiently adapt to changes in

IT Services workload, technology, and business requirements, in a sustainable manner

- Continuously monitor and optimise the performance and efficiency of applications to ensure they meet current and future demands, against service levels to make timely and quality decisions
- Service  levels  should  be  defined  when  new  processes  and  applications  are  being introduced and agreed between the provider and business owner
- Applications should produce metrics and alerts to identify where service levels are not being met
- Applications and services should not be designed with dependencies on deprecated components
- Employ performance testing and tuning as part of the development lifecycle
- Applications  and  technologies  should  be  energy efficient and optimised to reduce their environmental impact
- Ensure that IT partners and vendors have leading corporate social and environmental policies and practices, with sustainability-based certifications and documentation

## 16. Security by Design

## Statement

- Security  is  integral,  and  must  be  considered  across  all  layers  including  application, device, network and identity

## Rationale

- Strong security, and enhanced privacy for all is a constructive, win-win for both the University and all users

## Implications

- All  applications  must  be  configured  and  maintained in a secure manner to protect the digital assets of the University
- Security requirements, including technical controls, auditing and incident management should be captured as part of requirements analysis
- Security design should be based on 'defence in depth' and assume that individual control failures shouldn't result in security breaches
- When  allowing  access  to  a  resource,  assign  the  minimum  necessary  privileges  /

'minimum access (rights and permissions)'   that are required for users to complete their job function. These permissions must be reviewed on a regular basis

- All applications should implement robust user account management and role-based access control - permissions should be assigned, relevant to the user's role(s) in UCD
- Processes must be put in place to create, update, and remove accounts and update role-based access permissions as employees leave UCD or move to new positions
- Privileged accounts (accounts with administrative, or root access, or other special or elevated  permissions)  must  not  be  used  for  routine  access,  must  be  proactively monitored,  must  have  enhanced  security  measures  applied  (such  as  multi  factor authentication), and all user access routinely reviewed
- Access to all applications processing University data must be password protected and adhere to UCD's Password Protection Policy
- Devices accessing or connecting to University systems and networks must adhere to UCD's Device Protection Policy
- Users access or connecting to University systems and networks must adhere to UCD's Information Technology Services Acceptable Use Policy
- All security incidents must be reported to the appropriate authority in the University
