Research Ethics Committee

## 1. Purpose

UCD is fully committed to the advancement of high-quality academic research and to ensuring that all research  activities  undertaken  by  members  of  the  UCD  Community  or  on  University  premises  are undertaken lawfully in accordance with international best practice.

Research  undertaken  in  UCD  that  involves  human  participants  or  their  personal  data,  shall  be undertaken in a way that safeguards the welfare, dignity, rights, health, safety and privacy of participants involved.

Research undertaken in UCD that involves the use of animals shall treat those animals with respect and consideration. UCD uses animals for research where there are no alternatives and for teaching to pass  on  knowledge  to  students.  The  handling,  husbandry  and  welfare  of  animals  shall  follow  the university's best practice procedures as issued by the Animal Research Ethics Committee, the Animal Welfare Body and the Designated Veterinarians.

The purpose of the UCD Research Ethics Policy is to set out the basic principles of best ethical practice for all research involving human and animal subjects in UCD. The Policy applies to all members of the UCD Community and should be read in tandem with the UCD Code of Good Practice in Research with Humans and Animals and the Use of Animals for Teaching and Research Policy . These documents underpin  the  UCD  Research  Ethics  Approvals  System,  and  all  the  approved  REC  policies  and guidelines.

## 2. Definitions

- Research Ethics can be defined as the 'morally right thing to do' and, in the context of research ethics, this involves the protection of humans and animals in research. It is an internationally recognised process that ensures researchers engage in good practices for research involving humans and animals. Research ethics embodies internationally accepted principles (norms), regulations (laws and codes) and responsible practices researchers must abide by in conducting scientific research.
- Research  Integrity  relates  to  the  performance  of  research  to  the  highest  standards  of professionalism and rigour in accordance with the law and in the public interest.
- 'UCD Community' means:
- o all UCD employees, whether part time or full time, permanent or temporary;
- o all employees of UCD's wholly owned subsidiary companies or overseas campus/offices;
- o all registered students of UCD;

- o non-University employees who use University funds, facilities or other resources, including the  University's  name  and  reputation,  to  carry  out  teaching  and/or  research,  and/or participate in UCD-administered research, including retired employees, visiting faculty and researchers;  consultants,  contractors,  affiliated  hospital  staff,  industrial  personnel  and research fellows, regardless of obligations to other companies or institutions; and
- o all persons conducting teaching and/or research at or under the auspices of UCD including at any of UCD's overseas campus, including visiting faculty and researchers; consultants; contractors, Emeritus or adjunct appointments; and research fellows.

## 3. Scope

All  research  that  involves  either  human  or  animal  subjects  carried  out  by  members  of  the  UCD Community requires either a full ethical review or a low-risk study review (or exemption from full review in the case of research using animals). The definition of research may include the collection of data or materials  directly  or  indirectly  from  humans  or  animals,  as  well  as  any  information  that  has  been collected, observed, generated or created to validate original research findings.

## 4. Principles

This Policy is underpinned by the following principles:

- The University commits to the fundamental principles of academic freedom in line with the Universities Act, 1997 under Section 14, and the UCD Statement on Academic Freedom.
- UCD is fully committed to the advancement of high-quality academic research and to ensuring that all research activities undertaken by members of the UCD Community, or on University premises, that involve human participants or their personal data are undertaken in a way that safeguards the welfare, dignity, rights, health, safety, and privacy of those involved.
- Regarding the use of animals for research or teaching activities, UCD is committed to ensuring the animals are treated with respect and consideration. Their handling, treatment and welfare must  comply  with  best  practice  procedures  as  determined  by  the  UCD' s  Animal  Research Ethics Committee, Animal Welfare Body and Designated Veterinarians
- All  those  engaged  with  research  in  UCD,  including  all  researchers,  students,  technical, administrative and research support staff must:
- o maintain the highest standards of rigour and integrity in all aspects of research; and
- o ensure that research is conducted according to appropriate ethical, legal and professional obligations and standards.

In addition, there are several key principles which underpin the University's commitment to achieving the highest standards of excellence and best practice in research ethics.

## 4.1 Human Research

The basic ethical principles of respect for persons -beneficence (the duty to do good), justice and competence -are clearly defined in a number of important historical documents: T he Nuremberg Code (1947), the original Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and Revised Declaration of Helsink i (2024), and The Belmont Report (1979).

The Nuremberg Code ,  established in 1947 and adopted internationally in 1949, provides the basic principles of respect for the voluntary nature of human participation in research, true informed consent, and  ethical  responsibilities  of  the  researcher  to  ensure  human  welfare.  The  Code  stipulates  that research should involve minimal risk and harm, that the benefits should outweigh the risks, that only

researchers who are scientifically qualified should conduct research, and that participants should be free to withdraw from the research at any time. Subsequent codes have incorporated these principles.

The World Medical Association's 1964 Declaration of Helsinki made recommendations similar to those in the Nuremberg Code and established the International Code of Medical Ethics. The Declaration of Helsinki emphasises that the needs of research are secondary to the care and well-being of participants and distinguishes between therapeutic and non-therapeutic research.

The Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine states that the dignity  and  identity  of  all  persons  must  be  protected  and  that  respect  for  the  integrity,  rights  and fundamental freedoms of all people must be guaranteed, without discrimination. 1

The Belmont Report was published in the United States in April 1979, by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioural Research. The report summarises basic ethical principles and guidelines (respect, beneficence (the duty to do good) and justice), and provides an analytical framework to guide the resolution of ethical problems that arise from research with human subjects.

## 4.1.1 Respect for Persons

Respect for persons means that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents and persons with diminished autonomy must be protected. Ethics require that decisions are respected, and persons are protected from harm. Human dignity and individual rights must be treated with respect, and people should not be used merely as a means to an end. In practice, respect for individuals is ensured by the informed consent process in which a discussion of the research project occurs between the researcher and potential participants.  It is important to be aware that informed consent in the traditional sense of research participation in research ethics, is not the same as consent to the processing of personal data as the concept of 'consent' and 'explicit consent' unde r GDPR and the DPA 2018 is very specific [GDPR Article 4(11); Article 6 (1) (a); Article 7; GDPR Recital 32; GDPR Recital 33; the Data Protection Act 2018 (Section 36(2)) (Health Research) Regulations 2018].

## 4.1.2 Beneficence (the duty to do good) and Non-maleficence (the duty to not do bad)

Beneficence  and  non-maleficence  are  concerned  with  the  protection  and  well-being  of  human participants. The researcher is obliged to ensure that the possible benefits to the participants will be maximised,  and  possible  harm  minimised.  Harm  includes  physical  discomfort,  psychological  or emotional  distress,  and  social  and  economic  disadvantages  and  discrimination.  Researchers  must assess the potential for risks and the possibility of benefits to the participants and be sensitive to their rights and interests. In addition, researchers should reflect on the social and cultural implications of their research. In the end, the benefits to the individual  or the importance of the knowledge gained should outweigh the risks.

## 4.1.3 Justice

Researchers must examine the questions of justice and right, in terms of fairness in distribution of the research  benefits  and  burdens.  The  selection  process  must  be  scrutinised  to  determine  whether participants are selected in a fair and equitable manner, and for reasons directly related to the problem being investigated and not for reasons such as availability or manipulability. Particular concern must be

exercised in regard to vulnerable or dependent human participants. Researchers must only pursue research questions that are designed to contribute to knowledge,  be committed to the pursuit and protection of truth, and rely only on research methods that are appropriate to the discipline.

## 4.1.4 Competence

Researchers must strive to ensure and maintain the highest standards of competence in their work. They  should  recognise  the  boundaries  of  their  particular  competence  and  the  limitations  of  their expertise. In so doing, researchers should engage in only those research practices and techniques for which  they  are  qualified  by  education,  training  or  experience.  Researchers  must  show  ethical awareness, recognise the risk to human participants of exceeding the boundaries of their competence, and seek to terminate research activity when it is clear the activity is harmful. There is a duty on the researcher  to  maintain  and  develop  competence  by  remaining  up  to  date  on  relevant  knowledge, research methods and techniques.

## 4.2 Animal Research

The University requires that all members of the UCD Community will be familiar with, and adhere, to:

- a) All statutory requirements, specifically those in SI 543 of 2012.
- b) The University's Policy on the Use of Animals for Research and Teaching.
- c) All Animal Research Ethics Committee Guidelines

The  University  actively  supports  the  implementation  of  the  3Rs  (Russell  and  Burch,  1959)  Replacement, Reduction and Refinement -on which much of the legislation is based.

4.2.1 Replacement, Reduction and Refinement: all research and teaching involving animals should be conducted with the same rigour as research involving human participants. Members of the UCD Community must implement the 3Rs principles, which are a widely accepted ethical framework for conducting scientific experiments using animals humanely.

- Replacement: members of the UCD Community must support the development and uptake of alternatives to live animals in teaching and research and are obliged to use animals only when no alternative exists.
- Reduction :  members  of  the  UCD  Community  must  provide  statistical  justification  of  animal numbers and ensure that only experiments that are rigorously justified are conducted. It is expected that members of the UCD Community will maximise the amount of data emerging from animal experiments by judicious experimental design.
- Refinement : members of the UCD Community must ensure that animal welfare is prioritised when designing  and  conducting  experiments  and  must  possess  appropriate  training  for  whatever research is being carried out.

The University requires that animal care staff ensure that housing and husbandry is in accordance with best international practice guidelines.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
