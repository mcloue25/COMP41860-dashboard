## PROMOTION TO ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR/PROFESSOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT PATHWAY 7

## PROMOTION TO ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR/ PROFESSOR

## SENIOR MANAGEMENT PATHWAY

## 1 Introduction

- 1.1 This  pathway is  designed  to  allow  the  University  in  certain circumstances to confer the title of Associate Professor/Professor  on  internationally  recognised  scholars who  have  been  appointed  by  the  University  to  a  Senior Academic Management position.
- 1.2 This  pathway  may  be  activated  by  the  Vice-President  for Staff  and  Administrative  Systems  and  applications  will  be considered  by  the  President's  Committee  on  Professorships ('the Committee').
- 1.3 Appointment may  be made  at Associate Professor or Professor level.

## 2 Appointment

- 2.1 As part of the assessment process for the Senior Management position the Assessment Board will determine if there  is  a  case  for  recommending  the  applicant  to  be considered through this process and make a recommendation accordingly.
- 2.2 Alternatively if the Vice President for Staff &amp; Administrative Systems as part of the contract negotiation process identifies a case for the applicant to be considered through this process he will make a recommendation to the Committee.
- 2.3 Staff appointed to Associate Professor/Professor through this pathway will have an internationally recognised academic track record.  Prior to their appointment to a senior management post at the University, applicants will have previously held professorial appointments (or demonstrated equivalent academic activity, leadership and management performance) at UCD, or at another internationally respected, high-calibre institution.

## 3 Assessment Principles

- 3.1 Applicants  under  this  process  will  have  been  appointed through international competition to a  senior  academic management position.
- 3.2 As in the case of other Professorial appointment pathways, these appointments will be judged on international standards,  will  be  evidence-based,  and  will  be  entirely founded on merit.
- 3.3 The University's consideration of senior management Professorial appointments will be founded on:
-  The  academic  track  record,  leadership,  ability  and trajectory of the appointee;
-  The  status/ranking  of  the  institution(s)  where  the appointee has held positions previously;
-  The opinions of an additional three independent external assessors, if the Committee deems it necessary  to  supplement  the  external  assessment process  involved  in  the  assessment  for  the  senior management post.
- 3.4 In addition to having been appointed to a senior management position in the University and, in common with all  other  UCD Professorial appointments, appointees will be required to demonstrate exceptional performance in Research and Scholarship and Academic Leadership. Satisfactory performance in teaching and learning and University contribution activities must support appointment, however,  they  will  not  form  the  basis  for  appointment decisions on their own, or jointly.  (The type of evidence that may support an application is provided in Appendix A.)

## 4 Assessment Process

- 4.1 The  consideration  of  applications  will  be  founded  on  the principles of equality of opportunity, confidentiality and the application of transparent criteria in decision making.
- 4.2 The  Vice-President  for  Staff  and  Administration  Systems (Vice  President)  will  compile  a strictly  confidential case  for Professorial appointment for consideration by the President's

Committee on Professorships (the Committee).  Documents collated will include:

-  A concise statement by the Vice-President on the appointee's  academic  stature  and  leadership  qualities and how it is recognised internationally
-  Recommendation of Assessment Board, if appropriate
-  Applicant's  CV  and  application  for  Senior  Management post
- 4.3 The Vice-President will forward all relevant documentation to the Committee.
- 4.4 Where the Committee agrees that it has sufficient evidence to  make  an  appointment  it  will  make  its  decision  and  that decision will be final.
- 4.5 If  in  accordance with paragraph 3.3 (of this document) the Committee deems it necessary  to  supplement  the  external process with the opinions of three external assessors, a SubCommittee will be formed, consisting of the Registrar (Chair) and one member from each of the constituent membership groups (i.e. UCAATP  and  Professors of the Governing Authority).
- 4.6 When  the  Sub-Committee  agrees  that  it has  sufficient evidence to make an appointment at Professorial level it will make its decision, and that decision will be final.
- 4.7 If  the  Sub-Committee  is  established  in  accordance  with paragraph 3.3 of this document, it will report is decision to the President's Committee on Professorships.
- 4.8 The President's Committee on Professorship will forward its decision  to  the  Governing  Authority  and  to  the  Academic Council for noting.
