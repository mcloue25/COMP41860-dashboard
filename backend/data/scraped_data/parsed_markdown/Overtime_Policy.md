## Overtime Policy

Policy owner:

UCD HR

Approval date and body:

UMT, 6 June 2023

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the University's approach to overtime. Overtime is only paid to staff in exceptional circumstances, where it has been agreed in advance with the College Finance Officer or equivalent (i.e. prior to overtime being worked). It is the responsibility of the Head of School/Unit to ensure that this approval has been given before any overtime is carried out. Where there is an agreed requirement for additional work outside regular working hours, the norm is that time off in lieu is granted (as set out in principle 4.4).

## 2. Definitions

Overtime is defined as 'additional agreed work as part of your substantive post which is conducted outside of regular working hours'.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to any member of staff up to grade A01A and equivalent.

## 4. Principles

- 4.1 Overtime payments are made in accordance with the Public Service Pay Agreement applicable when the overtime work is being done.
- 4.2 Working Additional Hours: The usual process with regard to working additional agreed hours is as set out in individual contracts.
- 4.3 Paid Overtime: Overtime is only paid to staff in exceptional circumstances, where it has been agreed in advance with the College Finance Manager or equivalent (i.e. prior to overtime work commencing).

Claimants may not submit claims for overtime until after the overtime work is complete. Any claims forms received by UCD HR Operations prior to the work being completed will be returned.

It is University policy that claims must be submitted on a weekly basis for all authorised overtime completed each week by weekly paid staff and on a monthly basis for all authorised

overtime completed each month by monthly paid staff. Retrospective claims will not be processed without justification for the late submission and will require the approval of the relevant Vice President or College Principal.

- 4.4 Time Off In Lieu : Time Off In Lieu is awarded for additional agreed work conducted outside of regular working hours provided that the additional work has been agreed in advance. The Time Off In Lieu is awarded on a time for time basis ie. If you agree with your Head of School/Unit to work eight additional hours then the maximum Time Off in Lieu is eight hours. Requests to take any Time Off In Lieu accrued must be submitted to the Head of School/Unit.

## 6. Roles and responsibilities

- All claims for payment must be signed by the staff member and approved by the Head of School/Unit prior to being submitted to the Helpdesk.
- The Overtime Claim Form for authorised overtime should be fully completed and sent to hrhelpdesk@ucd.ie.
- It is the responsibility of the Head of School/Unit to ensure that the staff member has worked the minimum number of hours as outlined below under the Provisions of the Public Service Pay Agreement prior to approving overtime claims.
- On receipt of the signed Overtime Claim form by HR Operations, it will be assumed that the Head of School/Unit has confirmed that the minimum hours have been worked by the staff member.
- Details of the additional hours worked and dates on which the work was undertaken, together with the UCD personnel number and cost centre or grant code to which the payment is to be charged, must also be included.

## 7. Requests outside of the Overtime Policy

It is noted that in times of a national emergency such as the Covid19 pandemic, exceptional circumstances may arise resulting in requests outside of the Overtime Policy. If an emergency situation arises then requests should be submitted in advance of any work being done to the relevant Vice President or College Principal and the Chief People Officer and Director of SIRC &amp; Legal Services.
