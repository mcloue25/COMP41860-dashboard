## TITLE FOR PROFESSORS AND FULL PROFESSORS

## Approved by Academic Council 31 May 2006

Revisions approved by Academic Council 21 November 2019

Should they so wish, Professors and Full Professors may request the appropriate School and College and the Academic Council to approve titles indicative of their areas of expertise.

Where both a School and College have indicated approval in principle for such titles, the College should establish procedures whereby individual titles may be proposed and considered by the College. These procedures should be efficient, transparent and robust and be conducted by a Review Group with expertise in the particular discipline. Where a proposed title crosses Schools and/or Colleges, the review group should comprise members from both Schools/Colleges.

Where a title is approved by the School and College, the Principal/Chair of the Review Group should so inform the Registrar, in writing.  The Registrar will place the recommendation on the agenda for the Academic Council for approval.

The Academic Council notes that approval of a title for aProfessor or  Full Professor does not confer ownership of any particular field of study or research on the Professor or Full Professor.

## Procedures:

1. On receipt of a request, the College Principal will establish a Review Group to consider the request.
2. The College Principal will notify the Registrar of the establishment of the Review Group and its composition. The composition must be reflective of gender balance.
3. The Registrar will notify ACEC, and can do so electronically, of the establishment of the Review Group and its composition.  ACEC will be invited to propose amendments to the composition of the Review Group, which must be adopted by the Review Group.
4. The Review Group will consider the request and submit its recommendations to the College Principal.
5. The College Principal will notify the Registrar of the outcome of the review.

If the request is recommended, it will be presented to Academic Council or its Executive Committee for formal approval.
