## Procedure for costing staff time into research proposals

Policy owner

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish a procedure in relation to the claiming, recording and use of  University  staff  time  (defined,  for  the  purposes  of  this  procedure,  as  Employees  whose salary  is funded by way of core funding from the HEA Block grant or from internal University sources) in externally funded  research  grants.  The  costing  of  research-funded  staff  time  into  research  proposals  is  not covered by this procedure.

In  accordance  with  the  University's  Funded  Research  Activity  Policy  and  the  EU  Commission's Framework on State Aid in Research &amp; Development &amp; Innovation 2014/163 (the 'RDI Framework'), contract  research  provided  by  the  University  should  be  charged  at  market  price  and  any  research collaborations with industry must meet the conditions of 'effective collaboration' as set out in the RDI Framework. In  order  to  determine  market  price  for  the  purposes  of  contract  research,  and  also  to establish the University's contribution to a project for the purposes of meeting the conditions of 'effective collaboration', the University needs to have a documented record of the total amount of time spent on a  research project by all staff. This includes academic, technical or administrative staff directly involved in delivering the research project, but whose salary is funded by the HEA Block grant or from internal University sources.

## 3. Scope

This policy covers UCD faculty and staff and all those engaged in UCD research activity.

## 4. Principles

The principles of this procedure are to ensure that:

- (1) Where permitted, the University recovers the cost of University staff time involved in research activity.
- (2) The University charges a market price when conducting contract research.
- (3) The University keeps an accurate record of the University's contribution to a research project so that this contribution is recorded for the purposes of meeting the conditions of 'effective collaboration' set out in the RDI Framework.

Every effort should be made to maximise the contribution from research grants to cover the costs  of  University staff  time,  in  accordance  with  the  funding  agency/sponsor's  terms  and conditions.

Proposal -  University  staff  time  must  be  included  in  the  budget  where  eligible.  This  is  particularly applicable  to  work  funded  by  Industry,  charities  and  not-for-profit  organisations.  This  is  to  avoid  a situation  whereby  UCD  does  not  charge  in  full  for  the  costs  of  a  given  project.    The  charge  also recognises the value of faculty and researcher time and expertise to an external body.

Contract registration All externally funded research awards must be registered by completion of a grant registration form (GRF). The budget sheet analyses the total amount awarded over expenditure categories. University staff time awarded will be recorded as follows:

- Any University staff time awarded will firstly fund any shortfall in direct costs (eg PhD fees)
- Where there is a match-funding requirement, University staff contributions must be recorded and demonstrated as being chargeable to the project.
- Thereafter  University  staff  time  should  be  listed  on  the  GRF  as  'Other'  and  specified  as University staff time.
- The school should be notified of the amount of University staff time claimable from the grant.

- Each College Finance Manager (CFM) and College Principal (CP) should have an agreement in place as to how funds received for University staff time will subsequently be applied within the school. This may vary between consultancy and non-consultancy awards.

Expenditure - When the work has been completed the school must raise an invoice (*) against the grant  and  upon  successful  completion  of  the  project  or  acceptance  of  the  Cost  Statement,  the appropriate journals will be prepared to effectively pay this invoice. Funds will be credited to the school cost centre using account code 80649 (sundry income). This must be fully auditable to the satisfaction of the funding agency/sponsor. It will be the school's responsibility to maintain these records for audit. * Full accountability of time (e.g. a diary record or time sheets) may be required by external auditors and the University staff will need to make this available if such a request is made. Time should be recorded on a 'real-time' basis or as specified by the funding agency/sponsor.

Maximum PI time Claimable - An individual PI should claim no more than a cumulative 20% of their time through research grants p.a. It is the PI's responsibility to keep track of the amount of their time which is being funded through research grants. The exception to this is where a funding agency/sponsor allows for staff replacement, where 100% can be claimed.

Completion of the project At the end of the grant, any over spend will be charged against the school. Where there is an underspend on a project, any residual monies must be managed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.  Where funding is provided on a 'fixed rate' basis, or there is an absence of instruction on the treatment of residual monies, then these funds may be transferred to the school. The CFM and HoS may then provide the PI with an internal award to the value, in part or in full, of the residual amount, as per the pre-determined agreement.

| Principal Investigator        | Where a funding agency/sponsor allows for University staff time to be claimed, the Principal Investigator will include an appropriate charge (Basic Pay + on-costs) for any University staff time when preparing the budget element of their proposal. Where University staff time is provided on an industry funded piece of work, then the relevant market rate should be used (See ConsultUCD rates), |

| University staff              | Staff who directly or indirectly provide input to the research activity must complete a timesheet for their time on the project. This will form the evidential basis for which the cost is calculated and demonstrated.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| College Finance Manager (CFM) | The College Finance Manager will prepare and send an internal invoice to the Research Finance Office for the value of the documented University staff time. This should take place on successful completion of the work and acceptance of the Cost Statement or Invoice by the funding agency/sponsor.                                                                                                   |
