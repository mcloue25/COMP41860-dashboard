## 1. Purpose

Dissemination of the findings of research and scholarship through excellent publications is central to the  University's  mission. Appropriate  recognition  of  authorship  is  an  important  element  of  a publication, reflecting both credit and responsibility for the work.

## 2. Definitions

Authorship : Authorship is an explicit way of assigning responsibility and giving credit for intellectual work. An author must have made substantial intellectual contributions to the document, including all of the following four elements:

- a) Planning and Execution:  contributing significantly to the conception, design and/or execution of the work, and / or the analysis or interpretation of data; and
- b) Writing:  drafting, reviewing and/or revising the intellectual content of the manuscript; and
- c) Approval:  approving the manuscript to be published; and
- d) Accountability:  addressing any questions that arise, either before or after publication, around the accuracy or integrity of those aspects of the work for which the author is responsible.

The requirement for substantial intellectual contributions means that contributions such as routine data acquisition, leadership on a research grant and provision of samples do not on their own merit authorship, in the absence of the other responsibilities outlined in points a-d above. Equally, those who have made substantial intellectual contributions must be afforded the possibility to participate in activities a-d and therefore to qualify as authors.

Publications: Publications are defined broadly to include all dissemination of research and scholarship with a written record including, but not limited to, books, book chapters, articles, published abstracts and proceedings, and manuscripts.  Research theses, minor theses and student essays are excluded from the policy, but publications arising from these are included.  Patent authorship is covered in the University's policy on intellectu al property.

## 3. Scope

The scope of this document is to outline the policy of University College Dublin on authorship of publications arising from the research and scholarship of UCD faculty, staff, researchers and students.

## 4. Principles

- All contributors who meet the definition of authorship are entitled to be listed as authors in a publication, and those who do not meet the definition must not be listed as authors.
- Those who do not meet the definition of authorship, but have made a contribution to the work, may be acknowledged in the publication.
- The following are incompatible with the definition of authorship:
- o Gift  authorship:  authorship  offered  from  a  sense  of  obligation,  tribute,  or  dependence including, but not limited to, within the context of an anticipated benefit.
- o Guest  (or  honorary)  authorship:  authorship  offered  out  of  appreciation  or  respect  for  an individual, or in the belief that expert standing of the guest will increase the status, credibility or likelihood of publication of the work.
- The order in which the authors are listed, unless determined by the journal or publisher, is a collective decision of the authors, and must be agreed in advance of submission.
- It  is  acknowledged  that  the  terminology  used  to  describe  author  roles  may  differ  between disciplines.  Commonly, the 'lead author(s)' is/are the author(s) who take(s) the lead on delivering the publication; and the 'senior author(s)' is/are the author(s) under whose overall leadership the work was executed. These roles may be reflected in the order of the author list.
- The authors should also agree one (or occasionally more) 'corresponding author(s)', who may or may not be a lead or senior author, and who serve(s) as the principal point of contact with the publisher and others.
- In some disciplines or for some journals/publishers it may be necessary to agree and record the particular contribution of each author and their percentage contribution to the work, prior to final submission.
- No  author  can  be  included  without  their  knowledge  and  agreement.  Responsibility  for  a publication cannot be attributed to a person who had no involvement in the work leading to the publication.
- An author can withdraw their name from a manuscript through a written communication to the corresponding author.
- To avoid confusion and conflict, discussion of attribution and roles should be initiated as early as appropriate in the development of a project and subsequent publications, adjusting as required as the project evolves.
- Where there is dispute over authorship, every effort should be made to resolve this locally with the assistance of the Head of School / Unit and/or College Principal, who may convene a panel of senior academics to assist in achieving resolution.

Without an approved derogation, serious or repeated failure(s) to comply with this policy may be deemed a breach of research integrity.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities of Authors

- Authors should always adhere to the highest level of research ethics and standards in line with requirements  set  out  by  national  regulatory  bodies,  professional  and  regulatory  research

guidance,  relevant  research  funding  agencies  and  the  University's  resea rch  ethics  policy  and guidelines.

- Authors  should  seek  to  disseminate  their  research  findings  through  publications  with  the appropriate content, through channels that enhance the impact and standing of the work and in an appropriately timely fashion, paying due regard to considerations such as the protection of intellectual property and of confidential data.
- Authors should normally deposit publications in an open access repository, in the absence of a valid reason not to do so, and must comply with the requirements of the relevant funding agencies in this regard.
- Authors must  clearly  cite  and  acknowledge  all  sources  used  in  the  work,  including  their  own previous  work,  and  secure  copyright  permission  as  required.    In  particular,  authors  must  not present  the  same  work  as  original  content  (i.e.  without  appropriate  citation)  in  multiple publications.
- Authors  must  comply  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  relevant  funding  agencies  when publishing the findings of their research, and must acknowledge / disclose the source(s) of support for the work transparently and as required by the funding agencies or other relevant parties.
- Authors must comply with the University policy on conflict of  interest  and  must  disclose  any relevant conflicts of interest within publications and disseminations of research as appropriate.
- Authors must comply with the University policy on Intellectual Property, and before publication should  disclose  to  the  Knowledge  Transfer  Office  any  intellectual  property  that  should  be protected and commercialised.
- All authors are responsible for fairly evaluating their roles in the project as well as the roles of their co-authors to ensure that authorship is attributed appropriately.
- The  corresponding  author  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  persons  listed  as  authors  have received a copy of the manuscript to be submitted, know where it is being submitted, approve the submission and agree to be included as authors. This includes separate approval of resubmissions, either to the original journal following editing or to a new journal.  All of these approvals should be given in writing (which includes email), and copies of all such correspondence must be retained by  the  corresponding  author.    If  there  are  multiple  corresponding  authors,  the  division  of responsibilities must be agreed in writing.
- All authors are obliged to engage with this approvals process in a timely fashion.
- The senior author(s) is/are responsible for ensuring that no one entitled to authorship is omitted from the author list.
- If  new  information  becomes  known  post-publication  that  requires  the  research  record  to  be corrected, it is the authors' responsibility to do so at the earliest possible opportunity. The lead author(s), with the cooperation of the corresponding author(s), should take the lead on making the necessary communications with the other authors, journal(s) and funding agency(ies). In cases of re-publication or the publication of corrections to original work, all parties should be informed and consent should be obtained, except in extraordinary situations where this is not possible.
- Authors  must  notify  the  University  and  the  funding  agencies  of  the  withdrawal  of  previously published research, regardless of the circumstances, at the earliest possible opportunity.

- The full name of the University (University College Dublin) and of the relevant School/Unit(s) 1 should be stated in all publications.
- Full-time UCD employees with more than one institutional affiliation must list University College Dublin as their first / primary affiliation.
- Use of UCD core technology and other relevant facilities should be acknowledged as appropriate.

## 6. Variations

It is acknowledged that authorship practices vary significantly between disciplines.  Derogations from this policy may be confirmed through written communication with the Vice-President for Research, Innovation  and  Impact  if  they  are  based  on  clearly  established  practice  within  a  discipline;  are recommended by the College Principal; and approved by the Vice-President for Research, Innovation and Impact.
