Body:

Academic Council

Version:

1.8

## 1. Purpose

This policy aims to address the needs of UCD students registered to research degree programmes who have, as part of their approved study plan, undertaken to conduct significant elements of their research programme away from the University. It is also intended that this policy will safeguard the quality and academic standards of the University's research degree programmes.

## 2. Definitions

Split Site Arrangement : Where a research degree student, who is under the direct supervision of a UCD Principal Supervisor, spends more than 4 months or a continuous UCD trimester, whichever is shorter, carrying out their research at an organisation other than UCD or a UCD-affiliated site.

Governing Board: The Governing Board for split-site arrangements is the Graduate Research Board.

## 3. Scope

This policy refers to split-site arrangements for research degrees leading to a UCD award of PhD, Research Master's or MD degree.

## What is not covered by this policy:

- 3.1 Research degree students undertaking short-term (i.e. less than one trimester) fieldwork or visits outside of the University as part of their research programme.
- 3.2 Arrangements for students registered for research degrees at other institutions who spend a substantial period of time at UCD.
- 3.3 Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreements for PhD students, where a PhD Degree is awarded jointly between UCD and another institution. These types of arrangement are covered in the  Policy on Inter-Institutional Co-Supervisory Agreements (including Cotutelle) for PhD Students .
- 3.4 Research degree students working at UCD affiliated hospitals or UCD overseas campuses.

## 4. Principles

This policy establishes a university-wide set of standards and general principles to be applied to all split-site arrangements for research degree students:

- 4.1 Split-site arrangements for research degrees will only be facilitated, where it is deemed academically justified and appropriate, in accordance with the UCD Academic Regulations.
- 4.2 Every student under a split-site arrangement must have a member of staff of the external organisation formally appointed as an External Supervisor.
- 4.3 Every Split Site arrangement requires two written agreements to be formally approved by the Governing Board prior to the student commencing their research off-campus.
- 4.3.1 A Split-Site Hosting Agreement: This is drawn up between UCD and the external organisation specifying the host institutions' obligations to students and to UCD in relation to health and safety legislation. Where relevant, an Intellectual Property Agreement between UCD, the host and the student can be appended to the Hosting Agreement. A Hosting Agreement may cover a single student or multiple students over a number of years.
- 4.3.2 A Split-Site Supervision Agreement: This agreement provides explicit detail on the supervision arrangements for one specific student i.e. how often the student and the UCD supervisor(s) will meet and how those meetings will be organised when the student is away from UCD and include the pre-arrangements that are in place for Research Studies Panel (RSP) meetings.
- 4.4 The student's External Supervisor must be made aware of the UCD Academic Regulations and policies relevant to the supervision of research degree students.
- 4.5 The quality and academic standards of the University's research degree programmes will be maintained; split-site arrangements will result in no reduction in academic rigour.
- 4.6 The UCD Academic Regulations and policies apply to all students registered for research degrees at UCD who are undertaking split-site activities.
- 4.7 Equality, Diversity and Inclusion: Accommodation of any split-site arrangement will, in so far as is possible, take into account the University's strategic commitment to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion i.e. that UCD provides a positive working, research and learning environment, which is open to all regardless of age, disability, gender, marriage or civil partnership, race (including ethnic or national origin, nationality or colour), religion or belief, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the travelling community, or socio-economic status.

## 5. Approval of Split Site Arrangements

The prior approval of the Governing Board must be sought if a student is to spend more than 4 months or one UCD trimester at an external site, in accordance with UCD Academic Regulations . Applications for approval of split-site arrangements to the Governing Board must be accompanied by a Split-Site Hosting Agreement and a Split-Site Supervision Agreement both endorsed by the Head of School.

Split-site Hosting Agreements outline overarching responsibilities of the Host and UCD and may cover multiple students and an approved template is provided in Appendix 1.

Applications for permission to undertake split-site research should normally be made at the point where the student is being admitted to the University. However, in some cases, the need for split-site arrangements may not emerge until research is underway. In these cases, applications should be made as soon as possible and well in advance of the student commencing split-site arrangements. No research degree student should be working at an external site for more than 4 months or one UCD trimester without prior approval of the Governing Board.

In considering an application for a split-site arrangements, the Head of School and Governing Board will consider the feasibility of the proposed arrangement and may also consider an individual candidate's capacity to undertake research off -site as informed by:

- Supervisor(s) recommendations regarding the candidate's ability to self -manage and to meet their research and professional development goals while off-site.
- Evidence that the candidate will have access to the facilities and resources required to undertake their research while off-site.
- Evidence that the candidate will have access to a named, appropriately qualified External Supervisor who is familiar with UCD Research Degree Regulations.
- Evidence of an appropriate communication plan for the student and their UCD supervisor i.e. schedule of meetings in place.
- Review of an agreed arrangement as to how a PhD student will meet the taught 30-credit requirement and any other requirements of their programme.

These arrangements can be detailed in the Split-Site Supervision Agreement as outlined in Appendix 2. Any substantive changes to the Governing Board approved Split-Site Supervision Agreement e.g. schedule of visits, that occur in the course of the programme must be agreed between the supervisor and the research degree student and reported to the Governing Board.

## 6. Periods of Attendance At UCD

Students undertaking a split-site research degree are expected to spend an appropriate period of time at UCD. Requirements for attendance at UCD will be determined on a case-by-case basis and agreed by the relevant Head of School. Those requirements will normally be indicated to the student at the time of admission to the research degree programme.

Students who are approved to avail of a split-site arrangement will normally be required to make an initial visit to UCD on first registration in order to attend introductory course(s) and /or subject-specific skills training and to meet with their Principal Supervisor &amp; Research Studies Panel and facilitate the drafting and reviewing of their Research and Professional Development Plan (RPDP). Where applicable, research degree students are required to attend their Stage Transfer Assessment(s) (STA) and Viva Voce examination in-person.

Options for engagement with UCD include attendance at UCD in person, electronic methods e.g., email or video conference, attendance at some other location agreed with the research degree student or visits by appropriate staff of the School in question, to the candidate's site.

The timing and length of periods of attendance at UCD will be decided by the individual School,

following discussion between the research degree student and the supervisor, and will be set out in the Split-Site Supervision Agreement signed by the student, supervisors and relevant Head of School and approved by the Governing Board.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

## 7.1 Head of School

- The Head of School must make the recommendation to the Governing Board for any arrangement where a student is to spend more than 4 months or one UCD trimester, whichever is shorter, off-site.
- The Head of School is responsible for ensuring effective supervisory arrangements for the research degree student are in place at all times.
- Where a Principal Supervisor, for any reason, is unable to continue to supervise the research, the Head of School shall make every effort to secure alternative arrangements for the supervision of the student with minimal delay, including, where required, recommending the appointment of a new Principal Supervisor to the relevant Governing Board.
- If the split-site arrangement is not operating to the satisfaction of the research degree student or the Principal Supervisor, the Head of School must ensure satisfactory arrangements are put in place for the research degree student to complete their programme on campus.
- The Head of School is responsible for ensuring that there are appropriate systems in place in their School for the storage of a Split-Site Hosting and Supervision agreements relating to students in their School.

## 7.2 Governing Board

- The Governing Board must adjudicate on any proposal for a student to spend more than 4 months or one trimester off-site in accordance with the UCD Academic Regulations .
- The Governing Board must be notified if there are to be substantive changes to an existing split-site arrangement for a research degree student.

## 7.3 Research Degree Student

- Research degree students must abide by the University's academic and student regulations, policies and procedures including the Student Code of Conduct.
- A research degree student must actively engage with their University Supervisor(s), External Supervisor and other Research Studies Panel members on an ongoing basis.
- A research degree student who is approved for split-site arrangements must fulfil all the requirements of their degree programme including taught module requirements.
- A research degree student must inform their School if they are of the view that their split-site arrangement is not operating satisfactorily.

## 7.4 Principal Supervisor

- While a research degree student may be spending a significant period of time off-site, the Principal Supervisor remains the person with primary responsibility for the academic supervision of the student. Therefore, the Principal Supervisor must make every effort to support the student to progress within their programme by ensuring regular contact with the student using virtual platforms, email and in-person meetings to provide academic advice and guidance.
- It is incumbent on the Principal Supervisor to ensure the External Supervisor is fully aware of the UCD Academic Regulations , policies and procedures as they pertain to research degree students.
- The Principal Supervisor must inform their Head of School if they become concerned about the effectiveness of a split-site arrangement.

## 7.5 External Supervisor

- The External Supervisor must be deemed to be appropriately qualified with sufficient professional and research experience to assist in supervision, be a member of the student's Research Studies Panel and familiarise themselves with academic regulations, policies and procedures as they pertain to research degree students.
- An External Supervisor must be specifically approved by the Governing Board on the recommendation of a Head of School, and their name entered on the Register of Approved External Supervisors.
- The External Supervisor is the formal point of contact for the student at the external institution. The External Supervisor will ensure that the student has access to appropriate research facilities.
- The External Supervisor does not replace the Principal Supervisor but will provide local supervision at the external site and support the student-supervisor relationship.

## 7.6 Research Studies Panel Role

- The role of the Research Studies Panel is to provide advice, monitor the progress of the student, and support the supervisor(s)-student relationship.
- In a split site arrangement, the panel comprises the Principal Supervisor, Co-supervisor (if relevant), External Supervisor and at least two (but normally no more than four) advisers, one of whom must be a UCD faculty member.
