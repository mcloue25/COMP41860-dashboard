## Purpose

Effective recruitment and selection procedures are vital in attracting and retaining high quality employees from diverse backgrounds.

UCD is committed to attracting diverse applicants, including those from underrepresented groups aligned to University strategy and our values.

University College Dublin advertises all vacancies (both temporary and permanent) in line with our Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion Policy to ensure that equality of opportunity is afforded to all employees and potential employees of the university.

For recruitment and selection procedures to be effective it is essential that they are fair, rigorous, and transparent. It is the policy of the university to ensure that the best candidate for the job is selected. All decisions relating to recruitment and selection in UCD must be consistent with the criteria outlined for the post and with this policy.

Official Languages Act. The University's recruitment and selection procedures are subject to the provisions of the Official Languages Act (Amendment), 2021. Assessment Board members are required to engage with the Act and ensure compliance under the OLA for their School/Unit, as per the procedures set out by Gaeltacht UCD and UCD HR.

## Scope

These recruitment and selection procedures apply to all recruitment activity except for casual / ad hoc hourly paid appointments, and Research Funded recruitment. This policy should be consulted by all employees involved in any aspect of the recruitment and selection process. Advice and assistance can be obtained from UCD HR (Resourcing).

By order of the Governing Authority, no College, School, or Unit will be entitled to seek derogation on grounds of claimed special circumstance from these procedures. For information and guidance on the recruitment and selection of Research Funded positions, Principal Investigators (PI's) should refer to the Research Funded Recruitment and Selection

Policy .

## Principles

This policy has been put in place to support Hiring Managers whilst they undertake all the necessary steps involved in appointing new staff, or to replace a recently vacated position within their School / Unit.

|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 1 Consultation

## 1.1 Preparation and Planning are Key:

Effective planning and preparation are essential components of a successful recruitment campaign. To support all Hiring Managers from the earliest possible opportunity - and preferably, in advance of any regular Recruitment and Selection processes being initiated - it is recommended the hiring manager contacts the Resourcing Consultant assigned to their College, Vice President Office, School and/or Unit etc.

## 1.2 Resourcing Consultants (RCs):

The RCs provide specialist support to Hiring Managers in UCD by offering advice, guidance, and real time support for new and more experienced Hiring Managers on all aspects of resourcing in UCD.

## 1.3 Your Resourcing Support Administrator:

The Resourcing Support Administrator is a member of the Resourcing Support Team based within Resourcing. They are referred to as the 'Recruiter' associated with your post, and when assigned they will coordinate and oversee most of the Recruitment and Selection activities after a new vacancy is advertised.

## Note:

- ❖ It is recommended that Hiring Managers consult with their Resourcing Consultant at the earliest opportunity. The RC can be identified via the UCD HR A-Z webpage.

UCD, Heads of Schools / Units and line managers in UCD can expect to engage in the following processes with support, assistance and guidance provided by a member of resourcing.

## 2.1 Establishing a Vacancy / New Job Description

UCD's recruitment and selection process is usually commenced when the need to create a new position within a School / Unit's current (or evolving structure) has been identified; or the need to replace an earlier established / vacated post is confirmed.

When creating a new post, the first task is to clarify exactly what the post holder will do, and to then prepare a job description. Or alternatively, if reassessing the details of an existing position, Hiring Managers should consider whether the job has changed, and whether the job description needs to be updated to accurately reflect what the person in the post will now be required to do. Hiring Managers should also consider if role could be completed on a part time/job share basis.

2. Initiating a New or Replacement post (vacancy) - including:

## STOP admin maintains

## 2.2 Preparing Sizing, and/or Evaluating a Job Description:

UCD adopts a strategic and integrated approach to talent management which encompasses six core elements, one of which is talent/staff planning.

To achieve the objective set out above, the staff planning process will help inform the planning of resources to ensure the School / Unit has the right people, with the right skills, at the right time to meet its strategic and operational objectives. It is a methodical process providing managers with a tool for making clear, informed Human Resource decisions now and into the future. The process takes into account not only the HR factors, but directly connects to overall strategic, financial/budget considerations, environmental issues, legislative requirements / regulations and institutional governance. Fundamentally a staff planning process is an assessment of staff resources in place at a particular time. It identifies potential risks, highlights critical roles and related succession planning, and identifies the staffing requirements and skill sets needed in the future.

Strategic workforce planning is a collaborative process where alignment is reached across a number of stakeholders to meet the strategic aims of the School / Unit. A key tenet of an effective staff planning process is providing university leaders with quality EDI workforce data and analysis, including gender and other available diversity data which enables a deeper understanding of their staffing requirements and organisational structures.

The staff planning and budget cycle entails a series of meetings with key stakeholders, the format of which can be customised to meet local requirements. It is important to ensure that the annual plan in every School / Unit has a rigorous talent conversation underpinning it. Planning for new posts should occur as part of the integrated staff planning process and be conducted in conjunction with the local HR Business Partner and Resourcing Consultant who will provide valuable input into the Job Description and revised organisational chart prior to submission for evaluation. Planning for new posts should include consideration of current staff profiles regarding gender, race, ethnicity, disability and other equality grounds.

The job description is used to clarify roles and responsibilities and to enable the hiring manager to select the most suitable candidate for the post.

A well-conceived job description should focus on the purpose of the post and the principal responsibilities. This means identifying what the position needs to achieve but not the exact method by which the work is done.

To meet established norms, a typical UCD job description will include the following information:

- Position information such as post title and subject area (for academic posts), school / unit, grade, job family / career level details (where relevant) and reporting relationship.
- A position summary, or statement, summarising the nature and purpose of the role.
- A list of the principal duties and responsibilities.
- Selection criteria (both mandatory and desirable), and (where relevant) follow established Job Family norms.
- Equality, diversity, and inclusion declaration, and weighted selection criterion (applies to all grades outside of entry level grades)
- A University approved statement on how to access reasonable accommodations during the recruitment process for disabled and neurodivergent applicants. This should include a link to the Work at UCD (EDI) webpage for more information.
- Links to other supporting information, relevant to the post and prospective candidates.
- Whether or not Garda Vetting is a prerequisite for appointment.
- If Relocation Expenses and UCD Relocation Policy terms will be applicable to the appointment.

## Notes:

<!-- image -->

- ❖ A suite of job description templates has been developed by Resourcing and are available to help Hiring Managers compile this information. Additional information can be viewed on UCD HR's Home-Page / A-Z Forms.
- ❖ UCD Inclusive Hiring Guidelines and Checklist, and EDI inclusive recruitment and selection bundle are available to support Hiring Managers review job descriptions in partnership with Resourcing Consultants.
- ❖ Ensure job advertisement and associated materials are offered and accepted in accessible formats.

## A) Job Sizing: For all EA to SAOIV graded roles:

Job sizing is the process by which the pay scale or job grade for a particular administrative post is established. It is an assessment of a position, not a person. Job Sizing occurs when:

- A new post is created.
- A vacancy arises in a post that has never been graded and for which no comparable posts exist in the University structure.
- The responsibilities and accountabilities of an existent graded post have changed.
- For other vacant posts as required.

## Notes:

- ❖ For queries relating to Job Sizing (EA to SAO4 posts) please see Promotions &amp; Grading webpage.

## B) Evaluation: For all SAOIII to SAO1 graded roles (including grade alignment):

Hay Evaluation is the methodology used to evaluate any new Senior Administrative III to Senior Administrative I posts (or for certain roles operating at an equivalent level). Most Hay evaluations are completed by HR, but on occasion it may be decided a role will require external evaluation by Korn Ferry using the Hay process. When applicable, the cost associated with any external evaluations shall be borne by the relevant School or unit. Further details can be found in the Hay Evaluation Policy. The hiring manager should discuss the role with their HR Partner as an organisational design review will be necessary prior to the submission for evaluation.

Aligning bespoke and non-scale roles. Hay Evaluation is also used to evaluate bespoke and non-scale roles for the purpose of aligning them to a suitable UCD grade.

- A bespoke role is a position within UCD which is administrative in nature, but includes some tasks and activities typically associated with other role categories e.g., teaching, or technical duties.

- Non-scale or bespoke roles may be aligned to an appropriate administrative scale following evaluation.

For any enquiries linked to other role categories not captured in the above, please contact your designated Resourcing Consultant .

Interim / short-term vacancies (under 1yr): Job Sizing is not necessary for a post of less than 12 months. However, any short-term appointments linked to jobs requiring sizing cannot be extended beyond a year, and so a School or Unit will need to consider whether it would be better to complete the job sizing process in the first instance. Posts of 12 months or more cannot be advertised until Job Sizing (when applicable) has been completed .

## 2.3 Reviewing an Existing Job Description

Job descriptions should also be reviewed in all instances where the post becomes vacant, and before any recruitment preparations are initiated.

In relation to Administrative Professional and Support roles, when changes have occurred to a post over time, an application can be made to the University's Job Sizing Committee to determine whether the earlier confirmed Grade remains valid. Further advice should be sought directly from UCD Promotions and Grading in these instances.

## 2.4 EDI Considerations

Furthermore, Hiring Managers are also encouraged to consider the role of 'Equality, Diversity and Inclusion' in the recruitment process, and how they can best attract diverse talent. In preparing an inclusive job description, the language used can be a powerful tool, and inadvertently, job descriptions can include subtly coded language that affects how attractive a role is to a particular gender, the LGBTQIA+ community, persons with disabilities or those from a diverse cultural or ethnic background. Access to various tools, and additional information on inclusive training, gender-proofing, and other advice and resources to support inclusive recruitment practices can be found on UCD HR's 'Tips for Inclusive Recruitment' webpage. For example to 'gender-proof' a (new or existing) job description, words which have overtly masculine or feminine connotations should be avoided. HR recommends Hiring Managers pass all (new and/or revised) Job Descriptions through a preferred Gender-Decoder tool prior to submission.

## Note:

- ❖ More information on EDI in UCD is accessible via ucd.ie/equality/, and/or by visiting UCD HR website.

## 2.5 Hiring Requests - Including Approvals Process

Normal recruitment and selection processes are commenced when a Hiring Manager raises and submits an Online Hiring Form (OHF) via InfoHub to HR. The OHF is the established mechanism through which new or replacement vacancy details and all necessary authorisations (i.e., local, central, and financial approvals) are captured.

The necessary online approvers and/or reviewers are as follows:

1. Head of School/Unit
2. College Finance Manager
3. College Principal/College Officer/Vice-President
4. Resourcing Consultant (review only)

On occasion, the University may introduce additional mechanisms as part of the approvals and authorisations processes for new / replacement hiring requests. Your Resourcing Consultant will advise you on the need for any additional approvals.

## Note:

- ❖ Objective Grounds are a mandatory requirement for all fixed-term or specified purpose appointments. It is recommended that Hiring Managers discuss and finalise these terms with their RC at the earliest possible opportunity.

------------------------------------------------

3. Advertising and Promoting Job Opportunities - including:
2. 3.1 Advertise a Post
3. 3.2 Executive Search
4. 3.3 Search Champions / Search Committees.

## 3. Advertising and Promoting Job Opportunities

## 3.1 Advertise a Post

UCD HR (Resourcing) is responsible for the placement of all recruitment advertisements listed and promoted on publicly accessible locations and external to UCD, and for any details published on the Work at UCD website.

Hiring Managers must also follow the advertising and translation procedures set out by UCD Gaeltacht and UCD Resourcing in order to ensure compliance with the Act.

## Note(s):

- ❖ In some exceptional circumstances advertising may not be necessary, but in all cases, this will only be with prior agreement from UCD HR (Resourcing).

To advertise your post Resourcing must receive, a fully completed and authorised Online Hiring Form (OHF), and a detailed Job Description - which if applicable, has been through the job sizing process via UCD HR (Promotions and Grading). When the particulars of a vacancy have been fully established, external facing vacancies should be advertised for a minimum of two weeks. If it is anticipated that further vacancies which are identical to the original, then it will be possible to state that a panel will be created, and further roles may be filled from the initial advertisement. Vacancies may include a panel for subsequent (equivalent) permanent hires, or for temporary posts of various durations. When a panel is applied, agreed terms will be published.

All new or replacement 'Senior Executive Assistant' vacancies must be advertised internally in the first instance.

## Notes:

- ❖ More comprehensive details, data and an overview of advertising options, standards and the locations typically targeted for Academic, Support Professional / Administrative roles etc. can be found in the Resourcing section of the HR website and under the heading 'Advertising a Job.'

<!-- image -->

❖

- Resourcing has an advertising budget for supplementary costs; however, the hiring School / Unit may be required to contribute to the advertising costs for multiple websites / journals, or for advertising in press.

## 3.2 Executive Search / Agencies:

In some circumstances, recruitment agencies and executive search consultants are engaged by UCD HR and requested to advertise in additional locations. Applications in these instances may be collated centrally by these bodies before being directed onwards to UCD HR. Hiring Managers must consult with UCDs Procurement and Contracts Office to ensure compliance with regulations, prior to engaging the service of an external agent.

## 3.3 Search Committees / Search Champions

UCD's commitment to equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) is echoed throughout our recruitment process and UCD is keen to hire, attract and retain an excellent and diverse cohort of students, faculty, and staff.

Establishing a locally based Search Committee and/or an assigned Search Champion is one way in which Hiring Managers and Heads of School/Units can ensure diversity and inclusive recruitment is embedded in a regular and/or strategically important recruitment campaign. Engaging the support of a Search Committee / Champion is known to enhance the quality, quantity, and diversity of an applicant pool.

Using locally accessible networks, word of mouth and other focused communications - Hiring Managers and Heads of Schools / Units can play a valuable role throughout the Advertising and Promotions stages of a Recruitment and Selection process.

The application of any additional / specialised processes, and other recruitment measures should be discussed with your Recruitment Consultant during the Preparations and Planning phase; and with reference to the 'Tips for Inclusive Recruitment' webpage' mentioned in Section 2.4.

The primary method of selection in UCD is by means of an Assessment Board. An Assessment Board is established in respect of each post and is asked to recommend a candidate for each post. The Assessment Board assesses all applications against the advertised selection criteria.

For the majority of UCD's vacancies, written or on-line applications, short listing, interviews, and reference checking will form the basis of the selection process.

<!-- image -->

Some of the other techniques or tools available to supplement and assist with the Selection Process include:

- Work samples - a piece of work completed by the candidate during their previous experience that demonstrates skills or abilities relevant to the selection criteria.
- Work related tests - a scenario or activity that the candidate may expect to encounter in their day-to-day work is simulated. The academic presentation is one example of a work-related test.
- Psychometric testing - professionally administered tests which are used to measure individuals' mental capabilities and behavioural style. Psychometric tests are designed to measure candidates' suitability for a role based on the required personality characteristics and aptitude (or cognitive abilities). Applications of this assessment methodology are more typically limited to senior and / or more specialised posts in UCD.

Importantly, any additional assessment methods used must accurately and specifically assess essential or desirable knowledge and / or skills, as expressed in our published job descriptions. All published material and selection criteria are reviewed by HR to ensure that they are neither directly nor indirectly discriminatory.

Notes:

- ❖ Additional assessment methods, such as psychometric testing must be funded by the School / Unit and in compliance with Procurement guidelines.
- ❖ UCD reserves the right to add additional assessment methods as required and relevant to a particular recruitment process.

## 4.2 Board of Assessment and Recommended Levels of Representation

The deliberations of the Assessment Board should always remain confidential.

## Assessment Boards

Shortly after a position is advertised, the Resourcing Support Team member will issue the Head of School / Unit with a Board of Assessors (BOA) form, along with accompanying guidelines appropriate to the vacant position. The hiring manager (College Principal/Vice President, Head of the School/Unit etc.) will then nominate a chairperson and confirm the other members of the Assessment Board, depending on the category of position.

Note: The early appointment of an Assessment Board is recommended to ensure adequate time to develop a planned approach to the selection process. This will also allow Board members to review online applications through their Employee Self Service (ESS) account - which is accessible via Info Hub.

Recommended Levels of Representation on Assessment Boards:

|                                             | Number of Assessors   | Number of Assessors   | Chairperson               |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Type of Post                                | Internal to UCD       | External to UCD       | -----                     |
| Academic UMT / Full Professor and Professor | 4                     | 1                     | President UCD, or nominee |

- The Chairperson (or nominee) will confirm the final composition and details of other Board members.
- The College Principal or Head of School is by default, the President Nominee's if/when the President or College Principal is not a confirmed member of the Assessment Board.
- A President's nominee is applicable to all Academic vacancies of one year or greater.
- Management level employees and/or Industry professionals (operating at UCDs SAO4 grade or above) may participate on Faculty Boards, if/when a particular knowledge / expertise is absent from the Board and needs to be included.
- External Assessors are only mandatory for academic vacancies of one year or greater.

| Academic: Associate Professor / Lecturer/Assistant Professor   | 3   | 1   | College Principal / Head of School or nominee   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-------------------------------------------------|

Non-Academic: Including SAOIV levels and above and roles at an equivalent grade)

3

N/A *

Head of School / Unit or nominee

- All assessment boards should be operating at a comparative level to the vacancy, except in some instances, and when specialised expertise may be required, or an equivalent administrative responsibility exists.
- If preferable, an external assessor may be included in place of one internal assessor*.
* All non-academic categories that are aligned to specific scales: Including Other Academic / Teaching Administrative / Other Support, Library, Estate Services, and IT positions.

| Non-Academic, Including Technical roles: Up to and including AO1A, and roles at equivalent / established grades in UCD )*   | 3   | N/A   | Head of School / Unit, or nominee   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-------|-------------------------------------|

Although minimum numbers are specified in the above proposal, the Chair can choose to increase the size of the Assessment Board at their discretion. However, participating Board members should expect to participate and support this process for the entirety of the competition process. External Assessors must be 'external' to UCD and not to the College/School/Unit.

## General Requirements:

- All boards will have gender representation and the Chair should consult the Gender Balance on Committees policy which sets out the University's commitment to achieving a minimum gender balance target of 40% women and 40% men on all committees across the University.
- All board members are encouraged to complete recruitment and selection interview skills training, the EDI recruitment module and unconscious bias training.

- Members of the Assessment Board panel for faculty posts should normally be at the same level of the vacancy or above, however, consideration should be given to not overburdening underrepresented groups on the interview panel and to increasing the pool of board members by including academics for development purposes.
- In the case of administrative and technical posts, all boards of assessments should be operating at a comparative level to the vacancy, except where specialised expertise may be required, or an equivalent administrative responsibility exists.
- The Chair of the Board of Assessment may use their own discretion and engage the support of an additional / specialist assessor when it is determined a particular area of expertise or specialism is not being adequately supported by those convened to shortlist.
- A President's Nominee is required for all Permanent and Temporary Academic vacancies of one year or greater. Nominees must be agreed with the President's Office.

## 4.3 Managing Conflict of Interest

To avoid any real or perceived conflict of interest, UCD Employees involved in recruitment and selection should avoid interviewing and / or making hiring decisions on immediate family. If these circumstances arise, it is expected that the Assessment Board member will resign from the board and the Chairperson will identify a replacement.

Assessment Board members may also have a friendship or other form of relationship, positive or negative, with one or more of the applicants for a position. In these circumstances, they should inform the Chairperson and other Assessment Board members prior to commencement of the short listing and interview processes.

If the member of the Assessment Board feels that the relationship may make it difficult for them to apply the merit principle or feels that their participation may compromise the application of the merit principle, then the Assessment Board should decide whether it is appropriate for the Assessment Board member to be part of the selection process.

The Assessment Board may seek advice on this matter from UCD HR (Resourcing). If the Assessment Board member continues in the selection process, then their opinion should be canvassed last in any discussion to avoid any perception of them influencing the outcome.

Further details on this topic can be found in the Conflict-of-Interest policy, which remains the definitive source of information in relation to conflicts of interest.

## 4.4 Changes to Assessment Board Membership

While changes to Assessment Boards are to be avoided, if it is necessary to vary the membership the following procedures apply:

- Notify UCD HR (Resourcing) regarding the change of Assessment Board membership.
- Where changes in the Assessment Board membership impact the gender representation, every effort must be made to try and ensure the replacement identified will restore the appropriate representation although this might not be possible at short notice.
- In extenuating circumstances i.e., sudden illness, or an unexpected situation resulting in a Board member not being able to attend interviews, a replacement board member need not be identified and added to the Board.
- A replacement member must be given the opportunity to review all applications and may add any applicants to the shortlist for interview or consideration.

- Assessment Board members must be present for all interviews. If, in exceptional circumstances, a Board member cannot be present for all interviews they should withdraw from the Board and their views will not be considered by the Board of Assessment. A replacement Board member may be invited to participate on the Board to cover a particular area of expertise and this substitution must be clearly documented.
- If a new College Principal/Vice President or Head of School commences in their new role during the interview process the former College Principal or Head will remain on the Assessment Board in their original role as chair, if still an employee of UCD.
- If the Assessment Board composition drops below the minimum requirements, the Assessment Board may be reconstituted later.
- Any changes to the composition of the assessment board should be communicated to Resourcing. This is particularly important if the change will result in a lower than required number of assessors.

| 5. First Round Selection and Applicant Screening - including:   | 5.1 Short-listing 5.2 Short-listing documentation 5.3 Pre-screening process (undertaken by HR) / Search agencies   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 5. First Round Selection and Applicant Screening

## 5.1 Short-Listing

Shortlisting is defined as a process whereby candidates are assessed and scored by the Assessment Board against the agreed criteria, based on information provided in the application documentation, and to eliminate unsuitable candidates and to identify those candidates who meet the criteria for further assessment.

## Shared Documentation:

Once the application deadline has closed, UCD HR (Resourcing) will create and make available online shortlisting documents to each member of the Assessment Board through their ESS accounts. Documents will be circulated in line with service level agreements. UCD HR (Resourcing) will also email documentation to the external assessor (where appropriate). Shortlisting documents will include the job description and advertisement, a list of all applicants, merged applicant details, shortlisting scoresheets and Board of Assessment guidelines and example interview questions.

## Preparing to Short-List:

The Assessment Board members are then tasked with [individually and collectively] assessing applications to determine who will be invited to interview. 1

When accessing the applicant details on ESS, each Assessment Board member will:

- Log into ESS to access their online shortlisting documentation.

1 On occasion, the members of an Assessment Board may only have to review a reduced set of applications (see section 5.3 'Pre-Screening' for further details)

- Read each application and rate applicants according to the mandatory selection criteria only. However where a candidate clearly scores a '1' (meaning 'inadequate') for an element of the essential criteria then it may not be necessary to score the remaining criterion.
- Note any additional information required either before or at the interview.
- Briefly note the reasons for not shortlisting each unsuccessful applicant.
- The Chair must determine if any member of the Assessment Board has prior knowledge of any of the applicants who have applied. This is important to ensure there is no actual or perceived conflict of interest.

Short-listing meetings:

Ideally all members of the Assessment Board should attend a formal short-listing meeting arranged by the Chairperson in person or over a video conference call. When attendance is not possible, Board members must forward their draft shortlist, together with the applicant ratings to the Chairperson in advance of the short-listing meeting. The Chairperson will endeavour to take account of all Board Members input before the final shortlist is agreed.

<!-- image -->

## Furthermore:

- a) If it is not possible for the Assessment Board to meet, the Chairperson is responsible for contacting all members about their individual shortlists and then drawing up a final shortlist acceptable to all Assessment Board members.
- b) It is not necessary to score candidates against all criteria at this early stage of the process as long as the same criteria are scored for all candidates (for example, you may agree at the outset that 3 or 4 criterion cannot be assessed at shortlisting and record these as N/A ('not assessed').
- c) If there is a small applicant pool and the Assessment Board decides they will interview all candidates, then it is not necessary to complete the shortlisting score sheets.

Minimum requirements: The Assessment Board will:

- Agree on and record a final shortlist if unanimous.
- Include in the shortlist all applicants about whom there is dispute if unanimity cannot be achieved.
- Consider re-advertising the position if no applicants meet all the essential criteria.
- Shortlist further, where a substantial number of applicants possess all the essential criteria, to either remove those applicants who do not possess the desirable criteria, and / or rank those candidates who best meet the essential criteria. This may include a structured screening process over the phone to finalise the short list.
- Agree to exclude any applicants who fail to satisfy a clear-cut mandatory requirement, such as a specifically named qualification which has been completed to a particular level.
- Agree on a set of questions based on the selection criteria, which will form the basis of the Interview Plan.

## Assessment board members should not:

- Make negative assumptions or decisions based on perceived overqualification.

- Make negative assumptions or decisions about overseas qualifications with which they are unfamiliar.
- Make negative assumptions about gaps in CVs as this could be due to a range of factors including caring responsibilities.
- Apply discretion when considering minimum / clear-cut requirements, such as a targeted qualification, or a minimum level of award e.g., A third level or fourth level degree.
- Recommend for interview any applicant, whether internal or external, who does not meet the essential criteria.
- Predetermine the number of applicants to be interviewed.
- Make assumptions or discriminate based on protected characteristics (gender, marital status, family status, age, disability, sexual orientation, race, religion, and membership of the Traveller community) or socio-economic status.
- The assessment of applications from disabled applicants takes the provision of reasonable accommodation into account. A needs assessment is never part of the shortlisting for interview process.

## 5.2 Short-Listing Documentation

The Chairperson must complete a definitive short-listing scoresheet to verify and record the Board's decisions. These reports will facilitate any subsequent feedback requests from candidates.

Where the Assessment Board have decided not to score a specific criterion on the shortlisting form, the Chairperson should insert N/A ('not assessed') against this criterion. The Assessment Board must ensure the same criteria are scored in all instances.

The assessment board should return the shortlisted scoresheet to UCD HR (Resourcing) indicating clearly if a candidate has been shortlisted, reserve or is not shortlisted. Given potential implications for internal candidates, should you choose to have a reserve shortlist please contact your Resourcing Consultant in advance. Following confirmation of the candidate shortlist and receipt of the completed score sheet, UCD HR (Resourcing) will email all non-shortlisted applicants to inform them of this outcome. Non shortlisted applicants will be provided with their shortlisting scores should they request the same from UCD HR (Resourcing).

On occasions as stated above where all prospective applications are to be short-listed, individual scoring is not required.

The chair should confirm the recommended status for each applicant before returning the agreed record to UCD HR (Resourcing). Completed score sheets can be returned by email to HR and should contain expressed consensus from each individual board member.

A completed Interview Details Form should also be returned to HR at this stage.

## 5.3 Pre-Screening (undertaken by HR) and External Search Agencies

From time to time and for senior positions in particular, the Chairperson may request that UCD HR (Resourcing) undertake a 'pre-screening process' e.g. where there is a large pool of applicants, a specialist requirement(s) and / or pre-defined parameters to be met. HR will assess all candidates against one or more specific Mandatory Criteria or assist the Board by determining applicants who meet a specifically defined / published requirement prior to the formal short-listing process undertaken by the Board. Pre-screening will normally be conducted by the Resourcing Support Administrator in

conjunction with the Resourcing Support Manager; and where necessary additional input from a Resourcing Consultant / or a specialist / HR Manager best placed to advise.

Pre-screening of applications is not mandatory and is an optional step within UCD's recruitment process.

UCD HR may also engage an external executive search consultant who will assist with the pre-screening process.

Pre-screening processes undertaken by the executive search consultant may include the completion of a questionnaire by the candidate, and / or an interview. Interviews may be in person, or remote (via a telephone or video call); as agreed by UCD HR.

The pre-screening process and steps taken must be applied consistently to all candidates in a particular competition.

Where an applicant fails to meet the specified requirements, they are informed in writing by email and are not short-listed.

## Furthermore:

- In instances where the Head of School or Unit is not chairing a particular Assessment Board, the Chairperson must ensure that the pre-screening process undertaken by UCD HR (Resourcing) is fully supported by the Head of School or Unit.
- Chairpersons should be aware that incorporating pre-screening may impact the timeline of a recruitment process.

|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 6. Interview and Selection

## 6.1 Structured Interviews

Structured Interviews are the most used assessment tool enabling you to:

- Assess the personal attributes, past performances, technical skills, strengths, and weaknesses.
- Gain insight into attitudes and values
- Probe for inconsistencies and contradictions
- Provide candidates with more detailed information about the position.

## Preparation:

At the short-listing stage, the Assessment Board (under the direction of the Chair) should draft an Interview Plan with specific areas of questioning identified for each Board Member.

At this stage, members of the Assessment Board are prompted to log into ESS and access their individual interview documentation; whilst external assessors, will receive secured documentation electronically. The Board should:

- Agree a set of core questions which will form the basis of the interview and will be asked of all applicants. Supplementary or clarifying questions can be used in addition to the agreed core questions.
- Establish areas of questioning and focus on the selection criteria as specified in the Job Description.
- Focus on the skills, experience and knowledge required for the job.
- Determine in advance how they will rate the applicants against the answers they give to each question.

The Chairperson must ensure that the questions asked are relevant to the position and based on the agreed criteria. The Chairperson must also ensure that questions could not be construed as discriminatory under any of the areas covered by the Employment Equality Act, 1998 or University Policy i.e., Gender, Sexual orientation, Disability, Marital status, Religion, Race, Family status, Socio-economic-status, Age or Membership of the Travelling Community.

Assessment methods: For some posts it may be necessary to supplement the interview with other forms of assessment. The Assessment Board should notify UCD HR (Resourcing) who will advise short-listed candidates in advance of any alternative forms of assessment being undertaken.

The University reserves the right to introduce and apply a variety of assessment techniques such as:

- Giving a brief presentation on a particular subject.
- Demonstrating the safe use of a basic piece of equipment.
- Completing an assessment of computing skills, for example office applications.
- Writing/drawing on a particular topic.
- Psychometric testing.

<!-- image -->

## Remote assessments:

Whilst face-to-face interview is the most applied method used when assessing candidates, online / remote video conferencing is also considered acceptable; and may be preferable for certain categories of vacancies. However, it is strongly recommended that all candidates are presented with the same options and assessed using a common format.

## Scheduling and minimum notice periods:

The Chairperson is responsible for identifying and booking a suitable location for the interviews to take place ensuring it is an accessible space. A suitable venue must take into consideration reasonable accommodation's required by candidates.

UCD HR (Resourcing) are responsible for scheduling all interviews. UCD HR (Resourcing) will contact short-listed candidates and invite them to attend for an interview, or to self-select an interview time via

HR's online scheduler. It is the responsibility of the School / Unit / Chair (or nominee) to organise all catering required throughout the assessments process(es). Water should be provided as a minimum and be readily available to both members of the Board, and the candidates attending for assessment. Should any candidate(s) not be able to attend on the allotted date, the Board will decide whether an alternative interview date can be facilitated. This might not be possible, particularly where an 'External Assessor' is included on the Board of Assessment.

It is essential that candidates receive sufficient notice of an approaching interview and have ample time to prepare themselves, and any material required as part of their assessment i.e., the content of a presentation or seminar and / or, to gather any requested work samples or supplementary documents. In many cases, candidates will have the added requirement of coordinating travel arrangements and / or reasonable accommodation requirements.

Minimum notice periods (by category) are as follows:

| Post Category                                                                                              | Notice for Candidates   | Processing Period*   | Interview Notice Period (minimum)   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Non-Academic - when all candidates are internal to UCD                                                     | 5 working days          | 2 working days       | 7 working days                      |
| Non-Academic - both internal and external candidates (all of which are based in Ireland or further abroad) | 7 working days          | 2 working days       | 9 working days                      |
| Academic Appointments* (all candidates, all levels - based in Ireland or Internationally)                  | 7-10 working days       | 2 working days       | 10 working days                     |

## Note:

- ❖ Processing period: Additional processing time (per role) is also required for the preparation of screening and / or regular selection documents, as well as the coordination of interviews and any associated administration undertaken by members of the Resourcing Support Team. These, and other administrative tasks are routinely undertaken by Resourcing, and are necessary to ensure a fair, replicable and transparent process is applied.

## 6.2 Interview Preparation and Interviewing

Prior to the first interview the Chairperson should:

- Set a specific date / time to discuss and decide the order in which the questions will be asked and allocate specific areas of questioning to each member.
- Determine if any member of the Assessment Board has prior knowledge of any of the applicants attending interview where there could be a perceived conflict of interest.
- Advise Assessment Board members of the procedures for documenting the assessment of each candidate and final recommendations.

At the start of each interview, the Chairperson should:

- Introduce each applicant to the Assessment Board.
- Explain the purpose and structure of the interview to the applicant.
- Indicate to the applicant that Assessment Board members may take notes.

Additional 'Guidelines for Board Members' including sample interview questions are included within the Interviewer documentation issued by HR. Interview documentation is made available on ESS, two -3 working days in advance of any scheduled interviews. In addition board members are encouraged to review interview skills and unconscious bias training in advance of the interview date.

## 6.3 Second-Round Interviews

On occasion, second round interviews may be considered appropriate. When applied, the Board will identify certain candidates they wish to meet with again. The Board will seek to further explore key aspects of the role, and to assess (in greater depth) selected candidates fit with the mandatory criteria associated with the Job Description. New selection criteria cannot be introduced. Supplementary testing and an additional layer of assessment may also be introduced at this stage. Interview guidelines remain as per the first-round interview process.

## 6.4 Determining a Recommended Candidate(s)

A final selection / recommendation should be made based on the outcome of all selection tools and consideration should be given to how candidates rated across all the areas of the job's requirements, be that research, publications, teaching, leadership related experience or administrative factors. If the Assessment Board cannot reach agreement on the recommended candidate, a majority decision should be agreed, in the event of a tie the final decision rests with the Chairperson.

If the Assessment Board determines that no candidate is deemed to fulfil the mandatory criteria for appointment, no appointment will be made.

## 6.5 Documenting Interview Decisions

The recommendations of the Board, and its decisions pertaining to the selection of candidates must be documented.

Interview scoresheets completed by the Board will comment on the relative merit of recommended applicant(s) based on their satisfying and fulfilling the earlier established selection criteria. Clear and detailed documentation including qualitative feedback should be agreed by all board members on the scoresheet which will assist if post-interview feedback is requested by unsuccessful candidates.

A Recommendation Form is completed and signed by all members of the Assessment Board and returned by the Chairperson to UCD HR (Resourcing), including interview scoring records. Where remote interviews have taken place, the board's electronic signatures or expressed consensus from each individual board member via email will suffice.

Interview records must be stored in line with GDPR and FOI Policies.

## 6.6 Feedback (Post Short-Listing and Interview)

As previously outlined, a written record of the decision-making process is maintained by UCD HR (Resourcing) throughout the relevant stages of UCD's recruitment and selection process. These records are essential to support candidate(s) requests for feedback at either the post-shortlisting or interview stages of recruitment.

Formal feedback must be provided in either instance when requested. In most cases, this feedback will be provided by the Chairperson, unless a suitable alternative is nominated because of their specialist knowledge (particularly in academic appointments).

The purpose of feedback is to provide factual and accurate information on the selection and decision-making process. However, feedback on areas where a candidate may improve on interview skills and interview preparation might also be discussed. Of course, it is important to confirm if this level of supplementary feedback is desirable before offering constructive advice.

Feedback can be given verbally or in writing. The conversation or email / letter should provide qualitative feedback to a candidate that is both informative and helpful towards the candidate's development. In addition to the feedback above, a candidate may also be given a copy of their shortlisting / interview scoring form.

Very many of the applicants to professional, administrative, and technical roles within the University are internal. As an employer, it is particularly important that these applicants are provided with feedback which will assist them when applying for future opportunities.

Advice and assistance on preparing and delivering candidate feedback is available from UCD HR (Resourcing).

FOI and Record Management: The University's recruitment and selection procedures are subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and 2003 and the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. Assessment Board members should be aware that any notes that they make about any of the candidates may be discoverable; and are covered by Freedom of Information legislation. It is important that your decision-making process is clearly and comprehensively documented, and that all assessment records, including any individual notes of panel members are retained and returned to UCD HR (Resourcing) for storage in accordance with the University's record management procedures. If in doubt about the status of assessment records, contact UCD HR (Resourcing).

## Note:

- ❖ Additional information on FOI best practices in UCD can be accessed via UCD's Records Management and Freedom of Information Office.

## 6.7 Post Interview Communications and Recorded Candidate Status

Each candidate's application status will be updated as UCD's Recruitment and Selection process is applied. Following interviews, candidates are recorded as:

- Successful candidate(s)
- Reserve Candidates
- Unsuccessful candidate(s)

UCD HR (Resourcing) will advise unsuccessful applicants within (3 days) of receipt of the Assessment Board's Report.

## Note:

- ❖ Assessment Board Members should not directly contact ANY unsuccessful applicants after the interview process is completed.

Reserve candidate(s) - without a panel:

Where the Assessment Board recommends a reserve candidate(s), that person is deemed to be 'appointable' Therefore they can expect to be approached and further consideration given should the primary recommended candidate withdraw; or decide to refuse an offer of employment. Resourcing will always consult with the Chair of the Board ahead of any follow-up processes / Reserve Candidate discussions commencing.

* NB: The eligibility of a Reserve Candidate is set and limited to six months from the date of Interviews.

Furthermore, if a repeat vacancy arises within 6 months of the date of interviews the Head of School/Unit (or equivalent) may consider those candidates nominated as 'a Reserve' and to recognise those individuals who were recently assessed and deemed to be appointable by a properly constituted Board of Assessors. As such, subsequent roles may be offered and filled without reverting to open competition again.

## Reserve candidate status (Including a panel) :

In some instances, UCD HR will seek to establish a panel of appointable candidates in accordance with a set of agreed / published 'Panel Terms', to ensure worthy candidates can be drawn upon for defined periods of between 6, 9 or 12 months following interviews; and thus enabling any new vacancy at the same level within a specific School or Unit to be offered without an additional competition.

Those placed on a Panel are deemed appointable and will remain eligible for any supplementary / repeat vacancies and must be considered for all subsequent opportunities arising during the lifetime of a particular Panel. i.e.,

- -Offers of appointment will proceed in accordance with the agreed panel terms. These terms are published by HR and are supplementary to the Job Descriptions details presented at that time.
- -The duration of any subsequent (i.e., secondary) appointments linked to an agreed panel, can and often do vary.
- -Temporary part-time roles / vacancies can only be offered from an established panel if the originally advertised vacancy (and Panel Terms) were in support of both a temporary full-time, and temporary part-time opportunities.

Candidates placed on a Panel, will be informed of their status in writing, and all earlier advertised Panel Terms and Conditions associated with a particular competition will remain, and be adhered to for the confirmed duration.

|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 7. Post Interview / Pre-Appointment Checks

## 7.1 Referee Reports

Referee reports provide another source of information about the candidate(s). They should be seen as one part of the selection process.

Candidates are required to authorise the University to seek references. No offer of appointment will be made unless satisfactory references have been received by UCD HR (Resourcing).

Referees should be provided with information about the position and be requested to comment on the candidate's ability to satisfy certain criteria, and to formally endorse an applicant's candidacy for a particular post. The information can be gathered in a written report or by consultation via phone.

Where a member of the Assessment Board is a referee for a short-listed applicant it is essential that at least one supplementary referee report is obtained from a person who is not a member of the Assessment Board.

<!-- image -->

In the case of Academic posts, a minimum of two references will be sought from all short-listed candidates in advance of interview, and copies of those received will be made available to all members of the Assessment Board.

Alternate Process (Academic Posts)

<!-- image -->

Alternate Process (Professional Posts)

## Furthermore:

- If a candidate is less than six months in their current post, they may nominate a second previous employer.
- All nominated referees must be able to comment on a candidate's skills, knowledge, and abilities relevant to the position on offer, and therefore, should have had responsibility at some point for supervising or managing the candidate.
- Character based references (Chaplin, School Principal or nominated peers etc.) may be taken in addition to the above, but not in place of an employer-based reference.
- UCD HR also reserves the right to request that alternative (or additional) referees be nominated in certain circumstances.
- The Hiring Manager may choose to waive references for an internal candidate who has satisfactory references on record.

Where the candidate's PhD is described as near completed or submitted, the candidate's PhD Supervisor should ideally be named by a short-listed applicant and contacted as one of their referees.

In general, references will only be requested for the Recommended Candidate(s) notified to HR following interviews.

At a minimum two references will be sought in support of non-academic posts. In order of preference, nominated referees should begin with the candidate's current employer or a manager or colleague who meets the criteria below. The second reference should be the previous employer. This process is subject to change depending on the applicant's employment history.

## 7.2 Verification of Mandatory Transcripts and Pre-Employment Medical

All candidates applying for a job where a qualification is a mandatory criterion will be requested to provide proof of their academic transcripts to HR Resourcing.

An academic transcript lists your complete academic history: programmes attended, courses studied, overall result at the end of each year examination (1H, 2H1, etc.), the degree and conferring date. A breakdown of marks for each subject can also be provided. No other form of verification will be accepted (e.g., degree certificate) and if received will cause a delay in the recruitment process until the correct documentation is received. The cost incurred by an applicant for requesting an academic transcript will not be covered by UCD. For qualifications obtained in UCD, please notify HR Resourcing who can verify these awards internally.

## Notes:

- ❖ A recommendation to offer a post will not be made if the candidate does not hold a mandatory qualification as advertised for the post.
- ❖ No formal offers of employment will be made unless UCD HR is satisfied that a candidate's academic qualifications are bona fide.
- ❖ Post-interview checks, relative to the category of appointment will be completed prior to any formal offer being made.

❖

Pre-employment medicals: The primary purpose of the pre-employment medical checks is to assess an individual's fitness for a particular position taking account of the requirements of that post.

Pre-employment medical assessments can:

- Help ensure the individual can perform the tasks effectively.
- Detect an infirmity that may be of danger to the worker or co-worker.
- Help determine if the job poses a health risk.
- Advise if any job restrictions or accommodations are required.
- Ensure health and safety best practice is applied.

UCD requires that candidates (for appointments equal to or greater than a year) undertake a pre-employment medical assessment as part of its Recruitment and Selection processes.

All information provided is treated in the strictest confidence and will only be accessible by our nominated Occupational Health Vendor (OHV). When necessary, the Resourcing Support Administrator will contact each candidate and outline the relevant steps to follow in accessing and completing the above process. All medical assessments are initially conducted via the online questionnaire, but on occasion, a further telephone or person-to-person consultation with the OHV may also be required.

Confirmation that an individual is 'medically fit for the proposed position' must be received prior to UCD issuing a contract of employment.

## 7.3 Garda Vetting

Several posts in UCD, particularly in the areas of medicine, health, social work, and education, require employees to undertake activities that will bring them into contact with children or vulnerable adults.

All recommended candidates who are intended to be employed in an area where they will have access to children and / or vulnerable adults during their employment / engagement must complete

the Garda Vetting Form and authorise UCD to conduct a background check via the National Vetting Bureau of the Garda Síochána (Vetting Bureau).

Where applicable, a candidate cannot commence in post until Garda Vetting is completed.

## 7.4 Work Permits and Visa Requirements

Permits: General Employment Permits, Critical Skills Employment Permits

UCD operates in strict compliance with current employment legislation; specifically, the Employment Permits (Amendment) (No 2) Regulations 2021,

It is an offence under the above Act for either an employer (UCD) or an employee of UCD (if a non-EEA national) to engage in an employment-based relationship within UCD without previously having acquired appropriate authorisation to do so. UCD HR (Resourcing) currently co-ordinates the application and renewal processes for General Employment Permits, Critical Skills Employment Permits, and Hosting Agreements, where necessary.

The Department of Enterprise and Employment website sets out clear guidance on who will require a work permit to start employment in UCD, as well as the steps to follow to ensure UCD and UCD employees meet the requirements of current legislation.

## Entry Visas: When applicable.

Candidates from certain countries may need an Entry Visa to attend interview. The visa process is managed by the immigration authorities and UCD has no role and no influence in the process. Permission to enter the country (Visa) is the responsibility of the candidate whilst permission to work is (work permit) is generally managed by the employer. UCD HR has no means by which it might influence or accelerate the processing of Permits or Visa applicants.

## Notes:

- ❖ The time involved in obtaining an Entry Visa can vary, and the permission granted is distinct from any formal applications undertaken by a registered employer in Ireland seeking to support a new-hire and ensuring they are working legally in the country.
- ❖ In Ireland, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) is primarily responsible for dealing with immigration and visa matters.

specified salary. The salary recommendation will be made by UCD HR (Resourcing) in consultation with the Head of School or Unit or Hiring Manager.

Assessment Board members other than the Chairperson should not contact the recommended candidate until after a formal offer has been made by UCD HR (Resourcing).

Conditional or 'subject to' offers may be issued by HR in exceptional circumstances and when there is a recognised urgency to confirm the Boards recommendations.

The Head of Resourcing must approve all conditional offers.

Specific conditions, such as work permit requirements, may be included in a formal letter of appointment. These conditions are to be met and validated before a Contract of Employment is commenced.

## 8.2 Probation

When applicable, probation is to be considered an extension of the selection process and is operated in an open, clear, and supportive manner to enable the University to make the appropriate informed decisions; and to determine whether a person should be retained in employment.

## 9. Other Appointments - not managed by Resourcing

## 9.1 Adjunct Staff and Visiting Academic

The 'Adjunct' title is recognised as an honour bestowed upon an individual by the University. The positions are reserved for individuals of superior achievement and distinction in their primary professional endeavours and who have been recognised by peers as outstanding in their fields. Normally, Adjunct appointees will be either fully employed elsewhere or retired from such employment.

For information on appointment of Adjunct Staff please see the HR website for Policy and Procedures for Appointment of Adjunct Staff

In the case of Visiting Academic staff , it is recognised that the University will regularly host visiting academics from other higher education institutions. It may be desirable especially for recurrent visitors or visits of long duration, to recognise these individuals with a formal University title. Visiting Academic Staff are individuals whose appointment to the academic staff will enhance the teaching or research profile of a School, Research Institute or College and contribute to the intellectual life of the University.

For information on the Appointment of Visiting Staff please see the HR website to view the Policy and Procedures.

## 9.2 Temporary Agency Staff

The use of Temporary Agency Services is an exception and should only be considered after all the typical channels for recruitment within UCD have been exhausted. The use of temporary Agency Staff may require the approval of the College Principal and College Finance Manager. Schools and Units are advised to check the current approval process with the Bursar's Office in advance particularly in relation to procurement rules.

Please note: An agency fee may apply where a temporary employee is initially introduced to the university through an agency and subsequently secures a further contract with UCD through open competition. This fee must be paid by the hiring school or unit.

## 9.3 Hourly paid staff, including Tutors and Demonstrators

For information on appointment of hourly paid staff, including Tutors and Demonstrators please see the HR website in the Pay section.
