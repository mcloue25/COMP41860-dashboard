## 1. Purpose

Space is a finite and premium resource.  Efficient management of space provides opportunities for growth in student and staff numbers as well as research, scholarship and innovation activity.  When considering the sustainable operation and development of UCD campuses, the effective utilisation of University buildings is essential.  Using space efficiently will ensure that new space is only constructed where required, reducing associated energy and material use and the overall impact of the University estate on the environment.

University space is a shared resource and for the benefit of the entire University community, whether this is allocated to an individual or shared.  The University will seek to facilitate the provision of more shared resources and provide the support and processes to enable shared spaces.  The quality and functionality of space can be a key differentiator in a global environment.  Quality spaces can enable better teaching, learning and research, and facilitate innovation and new ways of working across all aspects of the University functions.

This Policy sets out the principles by which the University will manage the design, allocation and use of  space.    This  will  ensure  that  the  University  estate  is  best  positioned  to  support  the  vision  and objectives of the University Strategy.  This Policy will apply to existing and newly developed space across  all  University  buildings  and  all  those  who  use  it.    It  will  be  kept  under  regular  review  and updated as appropriate.

## 2. Definitions

## Teaching and Learning Space

In order to facilitate evidence-based higher-education pedagogy it is necessary to have spaces and furniture that are adaptable and enable different configurations and teaching styles, supported by digital technologies as appropriate.

As learning occurs not only in the classroom, the University must respond to this need with spaces for supported learning, reading, library and congregation spaces that facilitate both individual and group study,  as  well  as  integration  of  digital  technologies  to  support  collaboration,  communication  and personalised learning experiences where appropriate.

In  addition  to  formal  and  informal  centrally  allocated  teaching  and  learning  spaces,  there  are requirements amongst Schools for specific spaces or technologies that have more limited scope for shared use.  These may include laboratories, core technologies, collections, computation facilities, digitally  enhanced  classrooms,  and  research  analysis  space.    The  allocation  of  these  spaces  will continue to be supported on an as-needed basis, where possible.

## Workspace

Workspace  includes  the  general  office  environment  space,  formal  and  informal  meeting  spaces, informal break-out areas and other support space.  Enabled by modern digital work-tools, the way people work is transforming.  Traditional workspaces are being reimagined with the provision of more flexible and shared workspaces that cater for non-dedicated desks for co-working, private offices and ancillary services in an integrated manner.  Spaces to facilitate meetings with students, colleagues and visitors (both private and informal) should be available within or in proximity to shared workspace.

No one type of workspace meets the needs of everyone, therefore, workspaces are designed around the needs of faculty, researchers and staff while balancing the need for efficient use of space and design that considers environmental performance and impact.

## Research Space

As a research-intensive University, the provision of purpose-built appropriate research space is crucial to  facilitate  Research,  Innovation  and  Scholarship.    Opportunities  for  shared  laboratories  will  be explored where suitable, facilitating  cross-disciplinary  research  and encouraging  collaboration and new research areas.

Management of research space, including laboratory, workshop and write-up space is devolved to relevant  Schools  and  Research  Institutes  for  the  duration  of  individual  research  projects,  and  the allocation  may  be  reviewed  by  the  University  as  needed.    As  with  workspace,  research  space  is considered on a case by case basis and designed specifically for the needs of users while considering future adaptability and sustainability.

## Social, Amenity and Informal Learning

Buildings are designed considering how people study, learn and work. The importance of interaction, engagement and time outside these activities, and how the UCD Community can be engaged and supported is also taken into account.

Informal learning areas and spaces that encourage students and staff to spend more time in University buildings, socialising, relaxing and reading is a consideration in both new and refurbished spaces.  Such areas  can  greatly  improve  the  student  experience  and  help  to  create  a  sense  of  community  and belonging within buildings and different discipline areas.

Amenities  such  as  cafes,  shops,  sporting  and  performance  facilities  are  an  integral  part  of  the University experience and a key on-campus resource.  A vibrant Sports and Student Amenities Precinct

provides dedicated facilities to enable a holistic student experience across a wide variety of sports and the performing arts.

## Third Party and Engagement Space

Space allocation is prioritised for activities that enable the core business of the University.  However, partnerships with industry and other collaborations are essential parts of research and innovation and are facilitated when possible and where these partnerships align with University strategy and policy.

In conjunction with University management, UCD Research, Innovation and Impact guides the use of space for research ventures and partnerships involving third parties and will ensure alignment with University  Strategy.  Other  third-party  relationships  commercial,  sporting  or  otherwise  must  be sponsored by a School, College or Unit. All proposals for allocation of space to third parties must receive  approval  from  the  University  Management  Team  (UMT).  A  licence  agreement  with  the University must be put in place for all third-party allocation.

UCD campuses and buildings are also essential for engagement with the local community.  University facilities will continue to be utilised to host conferences, events and functions, particularly outside of core teaching times.  Engagement spaces are managed and considered from a spatial perspective to ensure alignment with University strategy and other spatial demands.

## Residential Space

The University benefits from having significant on-campus residential accommodation which greatly adds to the vibrancy, life and sustainability of the campus as well as the student experience.  The residential villages provide students with bespoke student accommodation in safe and supportive environment.

Through the UCD Student Residential Masterplan, the University is working to increase the number of beds on campus while further enhancing the retail, sport, recreational, health and associated support facilities.  These additional bed spaces will allow a large community of students easy access to the University's recreational, sport and educational facilities while also reducing the commuting carbon footprint of the University.

The student residences village supports the creation of a nexus between the student residences and wider campus, providing social, sport, dining, educational and other support facilities to both the residential and wider campus community.

## 3. Scope

This Policy applies to all members of the University Community including students, faculty and staff, researchers and postdoctoral fellows, users of University facilities and amenities, and all visitors to UCD campuses.

## 4. Principles

Due to the pressure on space, a series of principles have been developed to guide the management, allocation and design of space in the University:

- The University owns all space within University buildings and allocates according to University Strategy and other priorities, as established by UMT.
- The University will continue to enhance its inclusivity through design and ensure accessibility and universal design principles are incorporated in new and refurbished spaces.
- Space should be fit for purpose and meet all statutory requirements.
- Allocation of space prioritises core University business i.e. teaching and research of the University.
- Space is allocated to Colleges, Schools, Units, Institutes and major funded research programmes on a task needs basis.
- The  University  may  re-allocate,  reassign  or  reconfigure  space  to  further  its  objectives.    The University  understands and values co-location in delivering inter-disciplinary objectives  and  in maintaining congruence in disciplines.  It will allocate space taking these into account.
- Space  should  always  be  used  productively  and  therefore  temporarily  dormant/excess  space should be made available for reassignment to other schools and units which have immediate needs.  Where space is not used on a full-time basis (e.g., part time employment pattern, mix of desk and non-desk-based tasks etc) workspace should be available to others when not in use.
- The University advocates greater sharing of space and facilities in order to improve utilisation of space.  Examples of this includes shared teaching spaces, meeting spaces, workspaces, communal and break-out spaces and other ancillary spaces.  To facilitate this, teaching spaces will be centrally managed.  Meeting spaces, whether centrally or locally booked should be made available to all UCD faculty and staff where possible.
- Specific, specialised secondary laboratory space that can be shared and managed centrally will be encouraged  where  appropriate  to  avoid  duplication.    Examples  of  these  include  stores,  clean rooms, equipment rooms, instrument rooms and preparation rooms.
- Space should be designed and used/in a way that enhances the University experience, providing stimulating, engaging and inspiring spaces for work, teaching, learning, socialising and recreation.
- New and refurbished space is designed on a task needs basis, with access to views and natural (or borrowed) light for the comfort and wellbeing of staff and students.  These spaces are designed to be as transparent and open as practical to let light through to all parts of the building.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

## Colleges, Schools and Units

All Colleges, Schools and Units have responsibility for ensuring that both allocated and shared space is used efficiently and effectively. All groups will be required to integrate spatial considerations into their planning processes.

## Estate Services

UCD Estate Services is responsible for maintaining and holding central UCD records relating to space allocation and utilisation. Estate Services will report on key metrics to the Space Management Group on an annual basis and may verify spatial records to ensure accuracy. Estate Services will provide technical support to Colleges, Schools and Units with respect to space reorganisation, refurbishment, adaptation  or  other  technical  advice  in  order  to  support  more  efficient  space  utilisation  and  to improve the University space.

## Space Management Group

## Management of Space

## Space Allocation

The University space allocation process is necessary to ensure an efficient, fair and transparent system for the allocation of space that will benefit the UCD Community and deliver on the University Strategy and the University Space Policy.  All space is made available on a temporary basis on the principle that all space on campus is University space and that units do not directly own space.  Informed by strategic requirements, the University Space Management Group may decide to repurpose or centrally allocate space.

Colleges, Schools, Units, Institutes and other groups allocated space are responsible for the efficient and effective use of this space.  They should ensure that their planning processes consider how to utilise their existing space allocation to the greatest extent possible.

In seeking to better manage University space, the principle of identifying the solution at a level closest to  the  unit  involved  underpins  the  management  of  allocation  of  space.    Where  a  space  holder identifies a need for additional space, they should seek to identify solutions for meeting the additional requirements within their existing space allocation and in consultation with management within their area.  Where this is not possible, a proposal should be presented to the relevant College Principal / Vice  President  and  possible  solutions  within  the  existing  College/Directorate  space  allocation considered. Estate Services will provide technical assistance when exploring solutions within existing space such as reconfiguration of existing space.

If  currently  allocated  space  cannot  be  identified  or  modified  to  accommodate  the  additional requirement, units may make proposals to the Space Management Group for consideration with the support of the College Principal / Vice President.  Activities that require new space should not be

initiated without the prior identification and approval for the accommodation required.  Where a proposal is of such significant scale or impact, the Space Management Group may escalate proposals for consideration by CPG.

Any proposal for new space must demonstrate how existing space is used effectively before additional space can be considered for allocation.  Estate Services will provide assistance and a series of space norms to assist in this process.

- Proposals for reconfiguration of existing allocation to improve space use should be addressed directly  with  Estate  Services.    Subdivision  of  space  should  be  minimised  to  ensure  greatest flexibility in use.  Where possible larger spaces should be shared to maximise their use and avoid building cost.
- Proposals for an increase in space allocation (within the existing estate) must clearly demonstrate how existing allocated space is and will be optimally utilised.
- Proposals  for  the  development  of  new  area  will  require  consideration  by  the  Capital  Projects Group and the rationale may be considered by the Space Management Group.

Please see below for an overview of the process by which requests for additional space by a space holder (College, School, Unit or Institute) are considered.

## Support &amp; Monitoring

Data-driven decision making is required for effective space management and planning.  The University will require Space Holders to maintain records of allocation, and usage and the University will support this activity through use of digital technology to support the administration, allocation and recording of space data.

Key performance indictors and metrics relating to space aid decision making and investment strategy relating  to  the  University  estate  and  facilities.    UCD  Estates  Services  will  provide  support  to  the University and to individual Schools, Colleges and Units with data, benchmark data, space reports and other technical supports.

Each College, School and Unit is responsible for ensuring their allocated space is used efficiently and for ensuring accurate space records of their allocation is kept. At a minimum, Units will be required to record  the  number  of  staff/students  occupying  each  space  and  the  categorisation  of  each  room (function). UCD Estates Services is responsible for maintaining and holding University records and will liaise  with  space  holders  regarding  details  of  their  allocation.  Estate  Services  may  undertake verification of records from time to time to ensure accuracy of records.

Spatial  information  will  be  supplied  to  the  Space  Management  Group  by  Estate  Services  where decisions relating to space requests, room reconfiguration or change in function will be assessed. Decisions will be communicated to the Head of School via Estate Services.
