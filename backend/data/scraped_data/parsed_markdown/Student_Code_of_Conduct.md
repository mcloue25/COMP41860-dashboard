Owner : Student Engagement, Conduct, Compalints and Appeals (SECCA) Approval date &amp; body: ACEC, 30 May 2024

## UCD Student Code of Conduct

The University is a community of faculty staff and students joined together for the common purpose of the advancement and dissemination of knowledge.  Becoming a member of this community means that you have joined a diverse and vibrant environment ,  and  you  have accepted the University's rules and the responsibilities associated with being a student here. It is important that you are respectful in your interactions with others and that you uphold the high standards of personal responsibility and integrity that is expected of everyone at UCD.

This Code of Conduct sets out the standards of behaviour the University expects of you. You should familiarise yourself with these expectations as understanding your responsibilities will help you to make the most of your experience and to contribute to a positive learning and living environment for others. The UCD Strategy highlights the University's values and aspirations and the Student Charter establishes the roles and responsibilities of all members of the University community.

The vast majority of students successfully uphold the University's expectations regarding good conduct throughout their time at UCD. Where breaches of the Student Code of Conduct are reported to the University the Student Discipline Procedure will be followed.

## 1. Standards of Good Conduct

The Student Code of Conduct is established on three principles: respect, responsibility and academic integrity.

## Respect

The University promotes a culture which protects the dignity and respect of everyone and which supports your right to study in an environment which is free from discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. All members of  the  University  community  are  expected  to  respect  each  other  and  to  contribute  to  the  creation  of  a  positive environment. See the UCD Dignity and Respect Bullying and Harassment Policy and the Dignity and Respect Sexual Misconduct Policy for more information.

Under this Code you are expected to

- Conduct yourself in a manner that demonstrates respect for your fellow students, staff members and the University's facilities and property.
- Respect those living around you and members of the local community. Behaviour that adversely impacts on others may impact the University's reputation. If you are living in University Residences, you must abide by the requirements of the License to Reside.
- Communicate with your fellow students and staff members in a respectful and courteous manner. This includes formal communications with the University such as feedback mechanisms and surveys.

## Responsibility

You are expected to act in a responsible way and take responsibility for your conduct. You should familiarise yourself with the standards of behaviour that the University expects and ensure that you are aware of your responsibilities as a UCD student.

You are expected to

- A bide by the University's academic and student regulations, policies and procedures including this Student Code of Conduct.
- Acknowledge and respect the authority of staff of the University in the performance of their duties and cooperate with them accordingly.
- Take  responsibility  for  your  behaviour,  on  and  off  campus,  and  ensure  that  your  actions  don't  have  a negative impact on yourself, others or the University.
- Uphold  the  same  high  standards  of  good  conduct  while  undertaking  internships  or  work  experience placements.
- Be responsible  for  your  student  ID  ensuring  it  is  not  used  by  others.  ID  cards  must  be  presented  to university staff on request.
- Ensure that you understand and adhere to your responsibilities and obligations under any regulations or codes required by placement providers or host institutions. Students registered to programmes with student fitness to practise requirements should consult their Student Fitness to Practise Programme Statements.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity requires every member of the academic community at UCD to act ethically, honestly and fairly. A lack of academic integrity in any sphere of university activity undermines the credibility and value of all that UCD does

and of the awards that it makes to students. Every member of the UCD community shares responsibility for upholding the academic integrity values that underpin our scholarly practice in teaching, research, and student learning; activities that underpin the foundations of our intellectual community at University College Dublin.

Academic integrity is a fundamental principle that should underpin all academic activity. You should value honesty in your scholarship. Working independently, expressing original ideas, and appropriately acknowledging the ideas of others are important skills that will benefit you beyond your time at UCD. Those engaging in academic misconduct negatively impact other students and diminish their own learning experience.

You are expected to

- Attend lectures and engage in all other learning activities of your programme; learn the core values and skills required to appreciate your disciplinary tradition and value the need for integrity and honesty.
- Abide by the Examination Regulations, the Academic Integrity Policy and any other academic conduct policies that the University may establish to ensure a fair and equitable assessment system for all students.
- Ensure that the work that you present for assessment is your own work and that the use of work and / or ideas of others are acknowledged using a recognised referencing system.  For information on referencing, citation and how to avoid plagiarism see UCD Library guidelines.

## 2. Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct (also known as academic dishonesty or academic malpractice) is any attempt by someone to seek unfair advantage in relation to [an] academic activity or which facilitates others to gain an unfair advantage, or to profit  from  the  sharing or selling of  your own or others' work without permission. Examples of academic misconduct include, but are not limited to the following practices.

The Academic Integrity Policy provides the following categories of academic misconduct and includes definitions 1  and relevant examples for each.

2.1  Plagiarism: Presenting work / ideas taken from other sources without proper acknowledgement. Plagiarism is a failure to cite or otherwise acknowledge ideas or phrases used in any paper, exercise, assessment or project submitted in a course but gained from another source, such as a published text, another person's work, or materials on the internet.

Plagiarism includes presenting work for assessment, publication, or otherwise, that:

- uses phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or longer extracts from published or unpublished work (including from the internet) without appropriate acknowledgement of the source.
- presents direct extracts without quotation marks or other appropriate indication. Note: It is not sufficient simply to acknowledge the source.
- copies  the  same  or  a  very  similar  idea  from  a  published  or  unpublished  work  without  appropriate acknowledgement.
- changes  the  order  of  words  taken  from  source  material  but  retains  the  original  idea  or  concept  without appropriate acknowledgement.
- copies or uses, without appropriate acknowledgement, any material from non-written work including, but not limited  to,  visual  and  digital  media,  images,  computer  code,  musical  notation,  recording  or  composition, performance or oral presentations; or
- uses the work of another student without appropriate acknowledgement in a way that exceeds the bounds of legitimate cooperation.

Plagiarism is unacceptable in academic work, even where it arises as a result of:

- poor referencing;
- error;
- inability to paraphrase; or
- inhibition about writing in the student's own words.

2.2.  SelfPlagiarism:  Reusing  one's  own  work  without  citing  or  acknowledging  its  original  use.  This  could  mean submitting one piece of work in more than one course.

1 Definitions are reflective of those identified by the National Academic Integrity Network in its Lexicon of Common Terms.

2.3 Recycling: The practice of data fragmentation or salami slicing where the author(s) separate aspects of a study or their work. Writers should recycle their own material carefully and sparingly.
