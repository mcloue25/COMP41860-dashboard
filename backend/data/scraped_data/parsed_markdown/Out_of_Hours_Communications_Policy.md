## Out of Hours Communications Policy

Policy owner

Culture &amp; Engagement, HR

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to make it clear to employees that they are not expected to read or reply to  work  related  communications  (for  example;  email,  Workvivo,  phone  calls,  notifications  and messages)  outside  of  their  normal  working  hours,  or  on  annual  leave,  except  in  exceptional situations.  This  policy  is  underpinned  by  the  WRC  Code  on  the  Right  to  Disconnect (see  Related Documents )  and  is  designed  to  promote  employee  wellbeing  by  demonstrating  the  importance of recovery  time  away  from  work  and  support  other  policies  such  as  Core  Meeting  Hours  which promote a family-friendly working environment.

## 2. Definitions

Normal working hours are defined as the hours the employees normally work to fulfil their role. Out of  hours  refers  to  the  time  an  employee  is  not  working  and  cannot reasonably be expected to be checking and responding to work related communications.

Exceptional situations refer to situations which are not normal and may require an employee to read and/or respond to work related communications. Examples include specific urgent deadlines having to be met or urgent updates regarding campus operation / infrastructure.

## 3. Scope

The policy applies to all University employees.

## 4. Principles

The  concept  of  'always  on'  is  widely  viewed  as  impacting  negatively  on  employee  wellbeing. Receiving and responding to work related communications out of hours can have a significant role in propagating this situation. Best practice in many organisations is to put some form of restriction or policy  on  the  routine  sending/responding  to  work  related  communications  outside  of  normal working hours.

Where  it  has  not  already  been  done,  a  new  approach  to  avoiding  unnecessary  or  routine  out  of hours communications should be adopted. Examples include the use of scheduling to send emails at an appropriate time and customization of notification settings within Workvivo.

No  part  of  this  policy  prohibits  an  employee  who  chooses  to  read  and  respond  to  work  related

communications  outside  of  normal  working  hours  from  doing  so.  However,  those  issuing  the communications should consider the urgency of the matter and scheduling functionality should be used in sending responses so that they are received at an appropriate time within working hours.

As  a  global  university,  it  is  recognised  that  working  across  different  time  zones  and  international travel  may  result  in  colleagues  connecting  at  different  times  outside  of  normal  working  hours  to complete their objectives. Again, this does not mean that the recipient needs to respond in the same time period and scheduling can be used effectively in such situations as much as possible.

This policy will be regularly communicated to all employees to ensure that there is knowledge of its existence.

## 5. Roles and responsibilities

People managers (including but not limited to, College Principals, Heads of School and Support Units) are responsible and accountable to UMT for the effective local implementation of this policy, and for creating a culture within which the wellbeing of all employees is respected and fostered. Employees should ensure that they manage their own working time and take care of their health and wellbeing in addition to being mindful of their colleagues when considering issuing communications outside of normal working hours. The  Equality  website  (linked  below)  gives  advice  and  suggestions  as  to  the  various  methods  and approaches that managers may take to implement this policy.
