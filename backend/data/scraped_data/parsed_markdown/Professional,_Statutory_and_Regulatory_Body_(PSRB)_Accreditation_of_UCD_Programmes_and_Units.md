A  designation  earned  by  a  person,  or  bestowed  on  an  academic  programme  or module  or  other  activity  which  qualifies  an  individual,  or  individuals  who  have completed a professionally accredited programme/module/activity or are members of a professional organisation, to perform certain jobs, tasks or functions, and/or to enter a  profession  and  practice  professionally. Professional  accreditation is normally renewable on a regular cycle (normally between 1-5 years) pursuant to a formal accreditation review exercise or other update to professional membership.

Any domestic or  international  professional,  statutory  or  regulatory  body,  authority, institute,  association,  council,  commission,  external  faculty,  register  (or  registry), registration  board,  qualifications  agency,  accreditation  committee,  society  or  other related organisation, which  reviews  and/or  evaluates  and/or accredits and/or endorses  programmes,  modules,  research  and/or  other  similar  activity  delivered through, at, or by staff, of the University, to ensure that the required standards are met for the relevant professions and that this standard is recognised by employers and  other  relevant  agencies  for  that  profession.    PSRBs  may  have  statutory authority over a profession or group of professionals, provide membership services and work to promote the interests of people working in a profession.

-  Enhancement of the student learning experience by linking theory and practice, where knowledgegeneration within the University directly interacts with professional practice in the 'real world';
-  Embedding  of  ongoing  quality  assurance  and  enhancement  of  activity,  as  evaluated  by  PSRBs which have extensive expertise in the relevant area, and which ensures that such activity is current and  reflective  of  changes  and  innovations  within  a  given  sector  and/or  academic  or  professional area;
-  Creation of pathways for graduates seeking to access the labour market for a particular profession, and promotion of professional status and/or membership to facilitate the growth and development of such graduates;
-  Provision  of  exemptions  from  professional  examinations  required  for  professional  licensing  or practice;
-  Promotion of the currency of the University's programmes and other activities in such a way as to make them easily recognised and understood by a global audience;
-  Provision  of  external,  international  and  peer  benchmarks  against  which  the  activity  within  the University can be regularly compared, with a view to promoting international best practice.

In order to avail of the benefits and opportunities outlined above, this policy:

-  Enables  the  University  to  publish  a  PSRB  List  which  includes  all  PSRBs  which  accredit  a  UCD programme/school/institute;
-  Creates  a  mechanism  to  enable  the  monitoring  of  the  frequency  of  interactions  between  the University and any PSRB;
-  Enables the integration of PSRB accreditation feedback and outcomes with other key elements of the University's statutory Periodic Quality Review process;
-  Facilitates the consideration of PSRB reports, and the programme/school/institute response or action plan, by Governing Boards, the ACQEC (as defined in its Terms of Reference), and Periodic Quality Review Groups;
-  Seeks to improve efficiency by identifying opportunities to streamline and align the processes for the preparation for professional accreditation exercises and Periodic Quality Review;
-  Enables  the  University  to  demonstrate  its  compliance  with  the  Quality  and  Qualifications  Ireland (QQI) Core Statutory Quality Assurance (QA) Guidelines and QQI reporting requirements.

## 5. Procedures

The  following  procedures  relate  to  how  information  about  relationships  with  PSRBs  is  managed  by  the University:

-  The  University  will  publish  the  PSRB  List  which  will  include  all  PSRBs  which  accredit  any programme/school/institute of the University.  This list will  normally  include  the  name  and  contact details  of  the  PSRB,  the  programme/school/institute  which  is  accredited,  the  date  of  the  last accreditation and the date of the next accreditation;
-  In order to ensure the accuracy of the published PSRB List, the ACQEC, via the UCD Quality Office, will periodically request updates and information regarding accreditation of any programme/school/institute from the relevant Head  of School  or Institute (or nominee), and/or the relevant Governing Board, including via the University Programmes Board (UPB);
-  In  the  context  of  the  University's  Programme  Development,  Approval  and  Review  Framework (PDARF), information regarding any PSRB relationship for a new programme must also be provided by  the  relevant  programme  proposer  via  Form  PDARF3:  New  Programme  Academic  Structure Proposal; 2
-  In the context of Periodic Quality Review, information about PSRB accreditation  must be provided via the Self-Assessment Report (SAR), the drafting of which is the responsibility of the relevant Head of School or Institute (or nominee).  Where possible or appropriate, the timelines for Periodic Quality Review may be adjusted to align  with  PSRB  accreditation,  with  a  view  to  reducing  duplication  of effort.  A Head of School or Institute (or nominee) may request such an adjustment to the relevant timeline through the UCD Quality Office in the context of planning for Periodic Quality Review;

-  The UCD Quality Office will provide, on the request of a Head of School or Institute (or nominee), information  regarding  the  statutory  Periodic  Quality  Review  process  which  operates  within  the University, where a professional accreditation exercise or PSRB may require this information;
-  Final versions of PSRB reports, and the programme/school/institute response or action plan, must be  provided  by  the  relevant  Head  of  School  or  Institute  (or  nominee)  to  the  relevant  Governing Board,  and  also  as  supporting  documentation  to  the  Periodic  Quality  Review  Process  SelfAssessment Report (SAR) for the relevant programme/school/institute. This will enable the relevant Governing  Board,  or  the  Periodic  Quality  Review  Group,  to  identify  any  issues  in  relation  to professional accreditation;
-  The ACQEC will periodically consider reports on PSRB activity throughout the University.  This may include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  a  final  summary  of  the  outputs  of  any  professional  accreditation exercise, and a final summary of commendations and recommendations made by any PSRB.  The ACQEC may, via the  UCD  Quality  Office,  request  copies  of  the  final  versions  of  relevant  PSRB report(s), and the programme/school/institute response or action plan, from the Head of School or Institute (or nominee), who are obliged to supply the report(s) and response or action plan upon such a request.

## 6. Roles and responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities of all relevant parties are outlined as follows:

##  Head of School or Institute (or nominee)

These individuals are normally responsible for liaising with the relevant PSRB(s), to ensure that a positive  and  constructive  relationship  is  maintained.  The  Head  of  School  or  Institute  (or  nominee) must, on request, provide information about PSRB accreditation within their domain, as well as the final  versions  of  all  PSRB  reports,  including  the  unit  response  to  the  report  or  action  plan,  to  the relevant  Governing  Board,  and  to  the  ACQEC  (via  the  UCD  Quality  Office).    This  must  also  be provided  as  supporting  documentation  to  the  relevant  Periodic  Quality  Review  Self-Assessment Report (SAR). The Head of School or Institute (or nominee) may request information from the UCD Quality  Office regarding the University's  statutory  Periodic Quality  Review  process for inclusion in the relevant documentation. The Head of School or Institute (or nominee) may also request, from the UCD  Quality  Office,  an  adjustment  to  the  Periodic  Quality  Review  timeline  to  align  with  PSRB accreditation, with a view to reducing duplication of effort.

##  Head of Governing Board (or nominee)

The relevant Governing Board is responsible for the quality of the programmes within its remit, and, therefore,  the  Head  of  Governing  Board  (or  nominee)  may  request  information  about  PSRB accreditation from a School , as well as the final versions of PSRB reports, all final commendations and  recommendations,  and  the  programme  or  school  response  or  action  plan.    The  Head  of Governing Board (or nominee) will also liaise with the ACQEC (via the UCD Quality Office) to ensure the accuracy of the University's published PSRB List.

##  UCD Quality Office

Acting on behalf of ACQEC, the UCD Quality Office will liaise with the relevant Schools, Institutes and Governing Boards to ensure that the University's published PSRB List is correct and up-to-date. Upon  request  by  a  Head  of  School  or  Institute  (or  nominee),  the  UCD  Quality  Office  will,  where possible (and if desired), harmonise the University's Periodic Quality Review schedule to support the programme/school/institute  in  its  preparations  for  a  PSRB  accreditation  exercise,  for  example,  by using the some of the same documentation (if appropriate) and scheduling a Periodic Quality Review either before a PSRB visit or as soon as possible after a visit. The UCD Quality Office will also, on request, provide a Head of School or Institute (or nominee) with information about the University's statutory Periodic Quality Review process, to assist with the drafting of the relevant documentation for a professional accreditation exercise. Acting on behalf of ACQEC, the UCD Quality Office may also request a copy of the final version of any professional accreditation report, and a final summary of  the  relevant  commendations  and  recommendations,  as  well  as  the  programme/school/institute response or action plan, which will be made available to ACQEC.

##  Academic Council Quality Enhancement Committee (ACQEC)

As  detailed  in  its  terms  of  reference,  the  ACQEC  will  receive  and  consider  relevant  reports, identifying  trends/issues  and  good  practice  and  recommending  appropriate  action,  as  required,

including  in  relation  to  reports  such  as  external  reports  on  academic  provision  and  professional services, such as PSRB reports.  The ACQEC, via the UCD Quality Office, may therefore request a copy of the final version of any PSRB report, and a final summary of the relevant commendations and recommendations, as well as the relevant programme/school/institute response or action plan. The  ACQEC  also  exercises  authority  over  the  PSRB  List  published  on  the  UCD  Quality  Office website.
