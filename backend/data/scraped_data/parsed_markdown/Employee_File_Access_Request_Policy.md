## Employee File Access Request Policy

## 1 Purpose of Policy &amp; Definitions

It  is  the  policy  of  University  College  Dublin  to  allow  personnel  of  the  University individual access to their employee file, held electronically in the HR Department .

## 2 Policy &amp; Procedures

The  employee  should  in  the  first  instance,  complete  an  Employee  File  Access Request Form and return it to the HR Records Officer. The form can be submitted via email to hris@ucd.ie or by post to Human Resources in the Roebuck Offices. Copies of the Employee File Access Request Form are available for download from the UCD HR Website at www.ucd.ie/hr/forms.

On receipt of the Employee File Access Request Form the HR Records Officer will collate  the  necessary information from the HR document management system and email a response to the requestor. In the unlikely event the requestor does not have access to email a copy of their information can be sent by post.

Before  any  information  is  disclosed  the  Requester  will  be  required  to  provide photographic  evidence  of  their  identification  e.g.  UCD  staff  card,  passport,  drivers licence.  This  can  be  scanned  or  photocopied  to  accompany  their  Employee  File Access Request form.

If the Requester wishes to view other material, which they believe is held by the University but not contained on the employee file, the Requester should contact the FOI Unit:
