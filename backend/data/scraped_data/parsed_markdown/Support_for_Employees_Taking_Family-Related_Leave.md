## 1. Purpose

UCD is made up of a wide range of people with diverse backgrounds and circumstances, which we value and regard as a great asset. This includes those who have family obligations and may be returning from maternity/adoptive or carers leave. The purpose of this policy is to demonstrate the University's commitment  to  supporting  those  returning  from  maternity/adoptive  leave  and  those  returning  from carers leave, through a variety of measures, to enable them to continue to develop their careers.

UCD's Strategic Objective five is to attract and retain an excellent and diverse cohort of students, faculty and staff, therefore ensuring family friendly supports are available to attract diverse talent and to retain existing employees is critical. Supporting parents and carers is also a commitment that the University has made in its Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strategy.
