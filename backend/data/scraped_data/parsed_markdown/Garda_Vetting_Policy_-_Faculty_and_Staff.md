## Relevant Work or Activities

'Relevant work' or 'activities' shall be understood to mean any work or activity carried out by a person, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to or contact with children or vulnerable persons.

## National Vetting Bureau

Since the commencement of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 on 29th April 2016, the national vetting unit of An Garda Síochána (known before the Act as the Garda Central Vetting Unit) is now known as the National Vetting Bureau. The National Vetting Bureau is the single point of contact in An Garda Síochána to conduct Garda Vetting. Its primary objective is to provide an accurate and responsible vetting service which enhances the protection of  children  and vulnerable  persons  through  enabling  safer recruitment decisions.

## University Liaison Person

A Liaison  Person is  a person who  is  authorised  within  a  Relevant  Organisation  for Garda Vetting to submit National Vetting Bureau Application Forms to the National Vetting Bureau on behalf of the Relevant Organisation and receive resultant disclosures

## University's Garda Vetting Review Committee

The University's Garda Vetting Review Committee refers to the group tasked with assessing information received via a vetting disclosure and the suitability of the person to perform the role.

The University's Garda Vetting Review Committee will comprise the following persons:

- A HR Functional Director (or nominee)
- A representative from Corporate and Legal
- A Faculty Member

## HR Functional Director

The  term  'HR  Functional  Director'  shall  be  understood  to  include  the  Director  of  Human Resources, the Director of Culture &amp; Engagement, the Director of People Development &amp; Organisational Effectiveness, the Director of HR Partners and/or the Director of HR Services, or their nominee.

## Vetting Disclosure

A vetting disclosure shall be understood to include particulars of the criminal record (if any) relating  to  the  person,  and  a  statement  of the  specified  information (if  any)  relating  to the person or a statement that there is no criminal record or specified information, in relation to the person.

## 3. Scope

This policy applies to anyone who is employed and/or engaged by, or applying to be  employed and/or engaged, and/or acts on behalf of the University who will have access to children and/or vulnerable adults in the course of their employment/engagement in a manner which is not merely incidental to the role of that person.

Individuals  who  are  not  directly  employed  by  the  University,  but  who  are  employed  by contractors (or sub-contractors) of the University and who will have access to children and/or vulnerable adults in the course of their duties in a manner which is not merely incidental to the role may also be required to undergo the vetting/clearance process.

## 4. Principles

The University is committed to taking all reasonable and practicable steps to ensure that only suitable candidates are appointed to positions which involve direct contact with children and/or vulnerable adults  which is  not  merely  incidental  in  the  performance  duties.  The  University undertakes that any vetting carried out as part of its obligations under the  aforementioned processes, and other statutory obligations, will be done so in an atmosphere of mutual respect, trust and transparency.

On this basis, the University aims to apply best practices as set out in the National Vetting Bureau, An Garda Síochána, Code of Practice - Garda Vetting and ensure that Garda Vetting is  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  National  Vetting  Bureau  (Children  and  Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 and 2016.

The University reserves the right to take such steps as is reasonable to the circumstances should persons identified in section 3 of this document fail to discharge their obligations under the Act and/or if information is obtained through the vetting process which necessitates same. Any  such  steps  should  be  necessary,  proportionate  and  reasonable  for  the  purposes  of protecting children and/or vulnerable adults and/or  fulfilling the University's statutory obligations. The University may also take any interim steps as it deems appropriate to the circumstances  in  such  instances.  Any  such  steps  shall  not  influence  the  outcome  of  any investigation or infer wrong doing on any party.

## 5. Vetting and Foreign Police Clearance of Applicants

The University relies on the National Vetting Bureau (NVB), in conjunction with Foreign Police Authorities, to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the suitability of any person who is carrying out work or activity, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to, or contact with, children and/or vulnerable persons.

It is noted that while the legislation only refers to Garda Vetting, it is University Policy to seek Foreign  Police  Certificates  (FPC)  from  applicants  in  relevant  cohorts  who  have  lived  and worked abroad as part of its vetting process.

Where a person is deemed to be required to submit to vetting, for whatever reason then that person  shall  be  required  to  complete  the  Vetting  Application  Form  which  is  available  at http://www.ucd.ie/hr/forms/.

The Vetting Application Form requires the person subject to the vetting to disclose particulars of any criminal record.

The  administration  of  the  vetting  process  will  be  carried  out  under  the  direction  of  the University Liaison Person and/or any other University employee as may be assigned such responsibility from time to time.

If the applicant has resided outside Ireland for a cumulative period of 36 months or more over the  age  of  18,  they  must  furnish  a  Foreign  Police  Certificate  (FPC)  from  the  country  or countries of residence. The University, however, reserves the right to request FPC for a lesser period  at  its  sole  discretion.    The  FPC  should  state  that  the  applicant  has  no  convictions recorded  against  them  while  residing  there  or  should  disclose  any  convictions  recorded against the applicant during the term of residence.

The University may at its sole discretion also require that applicants provide an enhanced disclosure by the completion of an affidavit or statutory declaration.

The University may, at its sole and absolute discretion, afford an employee or a potential candidate a period of up to six months to obtain the appropriate Foreign Police Certificate. This period may be extended only in the most exceptional of circumstances. Where every effort  has  been  made,  and  a  Foreign  Police  Certificate  is  unobtainable  in  a  particular jurisdiction then a HR Functional Director on behalf of the University, may, at their absolute discretion, agree to an alternative method by which a candidate/employee can discharge this obligation.

Should any information required to be supplied by an employee, third party or prospective employment candidate be false and/or not forthcoming then the University shall be entitled to rescind  any  offer  of  employment  or  engagement  and,  in  the  case  of  employees  of  the University shall immediately refer the matter through the appropriate internal policy.

## 6. National Vetting Bureau and Foreign Police Certificate Procedure for Applicants

The following sections outline the various stages that are involved in the vetting process:

## Stage 1: Identification of Vetting

The Head of School/Unit having consulted with the University Liaison Person as they consider appropriate will identify the types of posts that require vetting. This does not preclude the Head of School/Unit from deciding that from time to time that additional positions will require vetting. Certain  roles/activities  may  be  designated  by  the  University  and/or  liaison  person  as automatically  requiring  vetting.  A  sample  of  the  current  list  of  these  roles  and  activities  is contained in Section 9.  No assessment shall be required to be undertaken in respect of such roles and/or activities are a necessary and regular part of their role as vetting is likely to be a precondition of participating in such activities.

If however, a Head of School/Unit is of the view that certain roles in these areas do not require vetting, for example, due to the application of an exemption under the Act, an assessment shall  be  required  to  be  undertaken  before  a  decision  that  the  position  does  not  require automatic vetting is made. This decision shall be recorded by the Head of School/Unit and the University Liaison Person and subject to review if the activities undertaken in the role change.

## Stage 2: Advertisement

All  posts  identified  as  requiring  vetting  will  generally  state  in  either  the  job  description  or accompanying documentation that the post will be subject to vetting. The fact that the job description/advertisement does not contain such a statement does not preclude the University from requiring that such a post be subject to vetting/re-vetting.

## Stage 3:  The Offer / Contract

Following  completion  of  the  recruitment  and  selection  process,  the  candidate(s)  deemed suitable for the  appointment can be offered the position subject to them satisfying the full requirements  of  the  role  including  satisfactory  vetting  by  the  NVB.    This  will  be  explicitly reflected in the offer letter and/or contract, which will be accompanied by instructions on how to complete the Garda Vetting process.

No person required to undergo vetting shall be permitted by the University to engage in work activities  with  children  and/or  vulnerable  adults  until  such  time  as  all  parts  of  the recruitment and selection process including vetting by the NVB has been fully completed to the satisfaction of the University.

Whilst  the  University  may,  at  its  sole  and  absolute  discretion  afford  an  employee  or  a potential candidate a period of up to six months to obtain the appropriate Foreign Police Certificate, the contract will explicitly state that the offer and their continued employment is subject to them successfully completing the Foreign Police Certificate process within the stated period.

## Stage 4: Confirmation of NVB/Foreign Police response by Liaison Person

Where the information supplied by the NVB/Foreign Police is inconsistent with the information supplied by the applicant and/or those vetted under Section 7 of this policy, the University Liaison Person will contact the applicant to clarify whether:

- a) The information supplied by the NVB/Foreign Police is correct; or
- b)  The employee/candidate does not agree that the information supplied by the NVB /Foreign Police is correct, in which case the University Liaison Person will request the NVB/Foreign Police to review their information and confirm or review their initial response.

Where the vetting disclosure contains criminal records information or 'specified information', the University should as soon as practicable make available a copy of the vetting disclosure to the applicant. The University may also take any interim steps as it deems appropriate to the circumstances. Any such steps shall not influence the outcome of any investigation or infer wrongdoing on any party.

## Stage 5: Assessment of Information

The  University  may  take  such  action  and/or  invoke  such  internal  policies  as  it  considers necessary and appropriate in respect of any vetting disclosure.

Where a vetting disclosure contains convictions, specified information or information that is inconsistent with that provided by the applicant, then it shall be considered in the first instance by the University Liaison Person and a HR Functional Director who will determine what, if any, action is appropriate.

Where further assessment is deemed appropriate, this will be carried out by the University's Garda Vetting Review Committee.

The University's Garda Vetting Review Committee will comprise the following persons: A HR Functional Director (or nominee), a representative from Corporate and Legal and a Faculty Member.

The role of the University's Garda Vetting Review Committee will be to assess the information on the vetting disclosure and the suitability of the person who is the subject of the disclosure to perform the role.

The University's Garda Vetting Review Committee will gather facts and decide as follows:

1. The appointment can proceed/the employee may continue in their role;
2. There  is  a  finding  in  relation  to  the  suitability  of  a  candidate  in  which  case  the University's Garda Vetting Review Committee will determine if the appointment can proceed; or
3. In the case of retrospective vetting, re-vetting or a disclosure by any person who is employed and/or engaged by or acts on behalf of the University, facts gathered by the University's Garda Vetting Review Committee may be referred to the disciplinary policy or any other policy appropriate to the circumstances.

In considering this assessment, the University's Garda Vetting Review Committee may, interalia , consider the following criteria:

- a. All the information disclosed to it by the NVB;
- b. Previous employment history;
- c. Educational qualifications;
- d. Skills and competencies pertaining to the position sought/currently employed in;
- e. Performance at interview or job assessment;
- f. Satisfactory reference from acceptable referees in the opinion of the University;
- g. The nature and seriousness of any conviction or offence which may be recorded in respect of the individual;
- h. Mitigating factors, if any, in favour of the individual;
- i. The self-disclosure of any such offence by the individual;
- j. The age of the individual at the time any such offence was committed by the individual;
- k. The length of time elapsed since any such offence was committed by the individual;
- l. The  conduct  of  the  individual  in  the  time  elapsed  since  any  such  offence  was committed;
- m. Rehabilitative efforts undertaken by the individual in the time elapsed since any such offence was committed;
- n. Recidivism rate, if any, of the individual in the time elapsed since any such offence was committed; and/or
- o. Any other information relating to the commission of or involvement in the commission of an offence, or which would give rise or would be likely to give rise to a bona fide concern that  the  individual  poses  a  risk  to  the  safety  of  children  and/or  vulnerable adults.

This is not an exhaustive set of criteria. It is a general guideline to  criteria the University's Garda Vetting Review Committee may consider and take into account when assessing the suitability of an individual to undertake, or continue to undertake, a role or engage in a work activity.

## Stage 6 - Completion of the National Vetting Bureau / Foreign Police Procedure

Applicants, employees and/or any other person who is deemed to require vetting by the NVB, or the University, and who has satisfactorily completed vetting (and all other conditions of the appointment process) may be employed/engaged by the University.

Applicants, employees and/or any other person who is required to provide a Foreign Police Certification  may  be  employed/engaged  by  the  University  subject  to  them  completing  the process to the satisfaction of the University within six months of their commencement date.

## 7. Vetting and Foreign Police Certification of Existing Employees

## Retrospective Vetting

The University is required to request employees and or third parties who are already employed and/or engaged by the University in certain positions and/or undertaking certain work activities to  undergo  vetting  (including,  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  the  Foreign  Police  Certificate procedure).  Retrospective vetting will be carried out in accordance with this policy and all those subject to these requirements will  be informed that they will be required to undergo vetting.

## Re-Vetting

The University reserves the right to request any employee/third party to undergo vetting/police clearance  at  any  time  in  their  employment/engagement  but  in  any  event  at  appropriate intervals (currently every three years) or such shorter periods as may be prescribed under the Act or as may be deemed appropriate by the University.

The processes as outlined in Section 3 will also apply to Re-vetting and Retrospective Vetting of  existing  employees. The  University  shall  take  such  action  and/or  invoke  such  internal policies as it considers necessary and appropriate in respect of any persons failure or refusal to engage in the vetting process and/or in respect of any vetting disclosure made.

## 8. Disclosure of Criminal Convictions

It is University policy to ask any person who is carrying out work or activity, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to, or contact with, children and/or vulnerable persons if they previously have been convicted of a criminal offence(s).

Furthermore, there is an obligation on any person who is employed and/or engaged by or acts on behalf of the University to disclose any if they previously have been convicted of a criminal offence(s), are convicted of a criminal offence or have been/are indicted of a serious criminal offence.

It  will  be  a  matter  for  the  University's  Garda  Vetting  Review  Committee  to  consider  such disclosures on a case by case basis.

## 9. Posts which may require mandatory Garda Vetting/Foreign Police Clearance

If any person engaged by the University undertakes a role listed or is engaged in the activities listed below as a necessary and regular part of their role then they may be required to submit to Garda vetting and police clearance. This is not an exhaustive list and may be added to, amended or varied by the University from time to time and is subject always to any role and or activity being identified as requiring vetting/clearance in accordance with section 1 of this procedure.
