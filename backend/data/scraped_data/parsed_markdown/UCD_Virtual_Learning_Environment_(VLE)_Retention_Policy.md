Approval date and body: May 2024

University Management Team (UMT)

## 1. Purpose

The retention policy for the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) within the university is to ensure the efficient management and preservation of digital content and user data within the online educational platform. The policy supports the broader spectrum of information management and data governance. Its primary aim is to address concerns related to data security, compliance with regulations, resource optimisation, and facilitating effective learning experiences for students and educators.

The retention policy for the VLE is crucial for governing the lifecycle of digital assets, including course materials, user data, communication records, and administrative documents.

As a new module offering is created for modules each trimester, it is imperative that the university manages our digital assets more effectively, and ensures that the VLE does not become a data storage facility. This policy aims to ensure the integrity of the VLE is retained as a teaching and learning management system to support the delivery of teaching. Faculty will retain the functionality to copy learning material into new versions of modules to support teaching and learning, however only material required for module delivery be brought forward.

## 2. Definitions

- Digital Content: All forms of digital materials, including but not limited to course &amp; assessment materials, communication records, and administrative documents.
- User Data: Information related to users of the VLE, including personally identifiable information (PII), academic records, and user-generated content.
- Retention Period: The specified duration for which different types of digital content and user data are stored within the VLE.

## 3. Scope

This policy details the principles and procedures governing the retention of digital content within the university's Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). It applies to:

## Users:

- Students enrolled in modules offered through the university's VLE.

- Faculty members, instructors, and teaching assistants are responsible for creating, managing, and delivering course content within the VLE.
- Professional staff involved in the maintenance, support, and operation of the VLE platform.
- Any other individuals granted access to the VLE for educational or administrative purposes.

## Digital Content:

- Course materials, including lectures, presentations, readings, and assignments, are created and uploaded to the VLE.
- Communication records, such as discussion forum posts, emails, announcements, and chat transcripts exchanged within the VLE.
- User data and profiles containing personally identifiable information (PII), login information, academic records, and assessment results stored within the VLE database.
- Administrative documents, policies, and reports relevant to the operation and management of the VLE platform.

## Scope of the Policy:

## Data Retention:

- Defines the duration for which different types of digital content are retained within the VLE platform.
- Specifies retention periods based on regulatory requirements, institutional policies, and educational best practices.
- Outlines procedures for periodic review and deletion of digital content to ensure compliance with retention guidelines.
- Relates only to services supported by IT Services and does not include locally purchased or managed services within schools or colleges.

## Exceptions to the Policy:

- This policy does not apply to data once it is extracted or downloaded from the VLE by users for their own purposes. Any data exported from the VLE for individual purposes falls outside the scope of this policy, underscoring the user's responsibility for managing such data in compliance with applicable data protection laws and university regulations.
- Certain categories of digital content may be exempt from standard retention periods due to legal, contractual, or academic considerations.
- Exceptions may apply to specific types of data or circumstances where extended retention is warranted for educational, research, or administrative purposes. Procedures for requesting and documenting exceptions to the retention policy, including justification and approval processes will be made available on the IT Support Knowledge Base www.ucd.ie/ithelp.

Note: User accounts are disabled in line with guidelines provided by IT Services. When an account is disabled, all student interactions are hidden within a module and are only reactivated if the account is re-enabled.

## 4. Principles

## Guiding Principles of the Retention Policy:

- Compliance with Regulations: The policy prioritises adherence to relevant data protection laws, privacy regulations, and continued alignment with institutional policies governing the retention and management of digital content within the VLE.
- Data Security and Confidentiality : Protecting user data and digital content integrity, confidentiality, and availability is paramount. The policy emphasises the implementation of robust security measures and access controls to safeguard sensitive information from unauthorised access, disclosure, or tampering.
- Transparency and Accountability: The policy promotes transparency in the handling of digital content by clearly defining retention periods, access controls, and procedures for disposal or deletion. It holds stakeholders accountable for their roles and responsibilities in managing and preserving digital assets within the VLE platform.
- Resource Efficiency and Optimisation: Striving for resource efficiency, the policy aims to optimise storage space and computing resources by establishing guidelines for the periodic review, archival, and disposal of digital content.
- Learning Continuity and Quality: Ensuring the continuity and quality of teaching and learning is a key principle. The policy seeks to preserve and maintain access to course materials, communication records, and user data to support uninterrupted learning experiences for students and instructors.
- Flexibility and Adaptability: Recognising the dynamic nature of teaching and learning environments, the policy allows for flexibility in accommodating evolving technological advancements, pedagogical approaches, and regulatory requirements while maintaining consistency in retention practices.
- Ethical Use of Data: Upholding ethical standards in the collection, use, and retention of user data is fundamental. The policy promotes responsible data stewardship and prohibits using or exploiting personal information for unauthorised purposes.
- Sustainability and Best Practices in Data Management : The policy promotes sustainable practices in data management by minimising data redundancy, optimising resource utilisation, and reducing environmental impact. It advocates for best practices in data governance, including data quality assurance, metadata management, and lifecycle management, to ensure the long-term sustainability and usability of digital content within the VLE platform.

## Retention Periods:

The VLE content retention policy ensures that students and faculty have appropriate access to course materials within 'My Learning' for varying durations, consistent with academic progression and administrative requirements. This policy aligns with the university's recommended thirteen-month retention period for all assessed work and outcomes . Additionally, the policy encompasses not only the native VLE components but also integrated services for example virtual classroom and video management solutions, aiming to create a cohesive and comprehensive retention framework across all educational technologies.

Each academic year, new iterations of modules are created to reflect the current academic cycle, such as Autumn 2022 or Spring 2023. The policy specifies the maximum period that content for each of these module iterations will be available following its completion, ensuring that only the relevant and current iterations are maintained within the VLE environment. The retention duration for each module level, applied from the end date of the module iteration, is as follows: 1 :

Level 0 Modules: Content is retained for up to 2 years

Level 1 Modules: Content is retained for up to 4 years

Level 2 Modules : Content is retained for up to 3 years.

Level 3 and Above Modules : Content is retained for up to 2 years.

See appendix 1 for a worked example.

It is important to note that while the above outlines the maximum retention durations, certain elements of the VLE content may be subject to removal before the end of these periods by the previously detailed principles. These retention periods are outlined below.

1 Please note where programmes have a duration of more than four years, such as medicine and veterinary medicine, the retention period will align with the duration of the programme. Where new programmes are created with a duration greater than four years, the school should notify IT Services. via the IT Helpdesk.

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

- Facilitate the transfer or disposal of digital content no longer required for educational or administrative purposes.
- Adhere to data security protocols when accessing, sharing, or handling sensitive information within the VLE.
- Recognise that the VLE is designed for course delivery and interaction, and is not intended for the long-term archiving of materials. Instructors should consider this when planning for the storage of learning materials needed for institutional purposes beyond the immediate scope of the VLE. This may be relevant for faculty on leave or sabbatical in particular.
- When it becomes necessary to extract materials from the VLE, instructors must ensure these materials are securely stored and managed in compliance with data protection laws and university regulations.
- Faculty must ensure that students have access to learning materials to support their learning, this includes students who may have taken a Leave of Absence or have extenuating circumstances for individual modules. Students should not be disadvantaged due to the VLE data retention periods.
- Where a student requests extended access to modules due to extenuating circumstances, faculty members or a nominee (such as Head of School or School Head of Teaching Learning) ,where the faculty member is not available, should apply for an exception to retain module content via the exceptions process.

## Students:

- Access and utilise digital content and resources provided within the VLE for educational purposes.
- Report any technical issues, concerns, or violations of the retention policy to appropriate authorities.
- Adhere to acceptable use policies and guidelines for responsible use of digital content within the VLE.
- Retain local copies of learning and assessment materials beyond the retention periods should they wish to retain them.
- In instances where students have extenuating circumstances or a leave of absence, students must ensure that they familiarise themselves with VLE retention periods and if they wish to retain access to material they should request extended access to learning material with module coordinators, where applicable.

## Professional Staff:

- Assist faculty and instructors in managing digital content and communication within the VLE.
- Provide support and guidance to users regarding policy compliance, data management, and retention practices.
- Facilitate the transfer or disposal of digital content no longer required for educational or administrative purposes.
- Report any technical issues, concerns, or violations of the retention policy to appropriate authorities.

This table illustrates an example of the retention periods and deletion years for digital content associated with different module levels within the university's virtual learning environment, using the example of the year 2020. In this example, 'ABC20020' is a Level 2 module, indicating that staff and students would have access to the module's content for up to 3 years, with deletion planned for June 2024. However, it should be noted that associated materials, such as assessments, are retained for variable periods prior to this, as dictated by the retention policy.
