## Policy Management Framework

University Secretariat

## 1. Purpose

The Policy Management Framework establishes a standard and principles for policy development, approval, implementation and review across the University. The Framework ensures consistency and compliance and sets down a transparent process with reflexive stakeholder consultation and appropriate approval pathways.

## 2. Scope and compliance

The Policy Management Framework consists of:

- The principles and standard for policy development and review
- Operational procedures
- Policy template
- Policy proposal template and impact statement
- Document Management Protocol
- Support tools for policy development and review

The framework applies to any person, unit or committee responsible for the development, approval, implementation or review of university policy; and to all policy documents, including the Policy Framework.

University employees are required to understand their responsibilities and comply with university policies under their contracts of employment. Students are required to understand their responsibilities and comply with university policies under the UCD Registration Terms and Conditions.

## 3. Principles

Policies must:

- Uphold the University's core values, mission and strategic objectives
- Be consistent with existing University Statutes, Regulations and other Policies
- Comply with legislation and Codes of Practice
- Be guided by national and international best practice
- Be informed by continuous review and improvement
- Be developed only where there is a justifiable need; with long term application to the University
- Apply and be binding across the University

## 6. Operational procedures for policy development and review

Any policy development initiative, should follow a pre-defined cycle of initiation (policy proposal), drafting, consultation, approval, communication, implementation and ongoing monitoring and review (please see Diagram 1 on page 6). In circumstances, where the following criteria are met, an approval body may accelerate the approval of a new policy or amendments to a policy:

- a) A  new  policy,  or  amendment  to  an  existing  policy,  is  required  to  facilitate  a  timely  and appropriate  response  to  unprecedented  or  exceptional  circumstances,  as  deemed  by  the approval body; or
- b) An amendment to an existing policy, is required to align with changes in relevant legislation or to meet government or health and safety guidelines.

The process timelines and suite of approaches to consultation, proofing, approval and implementation may be adapted to meet local business needs, subject to any overarching governance and/or compliance requirements.

## 1. Initiation

A policy development can be triggered, for example, by legislative changes, strategic objectives or restructuring of the University or identified institutional risk or gap. A policy proposal should be submitted to the relevant governance or management body to assess the need for a policy development or review. The proposal should be submitted using the Policy Proposal Template and should include an impact assessment (equality and other relevant impact assessments). The approval of the policy proposal should involve an initial discussion and stated preferences on the policy principles.

## 2. Drafting and Development/Review

The Policy Developer/Reviewer should consider the policy issue, conduct an initial discussion on policy principles with stakeholders, carry out any relevant research including review of international good practice, formulate a draft policy document, undertake consultation with appropriate stakeholders, address any gaps highlighted by the policy impact assessment, and submit a final draft of policy for approval.

Policy should:

- Contain language that is plain English and appropriate for the audience
- Comply with the UCD Policy Template to ensure consistency across all policy documents
- Record the policy owner, approval body and approval date of the policy

## 3. Consultation

Informal consultation with interested parties is strongly recommended throughout the development of a new policy or a major policy review. The Policy Developer/Reviewer should seek to engage decision making groups on the character of policy problems to be addressed as a prior to step to developing policy solutions. Once a policy has been drafted, it needs to be made available for formal consultation with the relevant governance/approval body.

## 4. Approval

Approval of policies shall follow an agreed approval pathway which must be established at the outset of policy development or review. Policies are formally approved by the relevant governing body (University Management Team, Academic Council or Governing Authority) or by a senior officer operating under its delegated authority. Policy will be effective from the date of approval, if not otherwise specified.

## 5. Communication

All policies are published in the online UCD Governance Document Library in line with an approved Document Management Protocol. A policy published in the Document Library is considered the only authorised version. The Policy Owner is responsible for communications about a new or revised policy. A communication plan should be an essential part of successful implementation and application of a new policy.

## 6. Implementation

Implementation should be planned from the very start of a policy development process. It is important to ensure the oversight of policy implementation, in particular where the implementation spreads across different areas of the University. The Policy Owner should discuss policy implementation with relevant stakeholders to agree a timeline for all required implementation activities and to assign responsibilities for each activity.

## 7. Monitoring and Review

It is essential that, once approved, policies remain relevant, fit for purpose and consistent with the University's mission and objectives. Policy compliance can be monitored by recording issues arising from implementation, gathering feedback and by monitoring decisions taken under the policy. Information collected through monitoring activities is used during the formal review of the policy.

All approved policies are subject to periodic review. Reviews normally take place after 3-5 years of operation. Where necessary, policies may be reviewed outside the review cycle. Editorial or other minor amendments to policy may be made outside a formal review. Minor amendments to policy require the approval of the relevant governance body. Major amendments to policy can be approved and implemented only as a result of a formal policy review with appropriate stakeholder consultation. A review should consider whether the policy:

- Remains consistent with best practice and the strategic direction of the university
- Continues to meet stakeholder needs
- Complies with any existing related policies, and supports university statutes and regulations
- Works well on an operational level
- Could be enhanced

## Policy Development/Review Pilot Equality Impact Assessment Form

<!-- image -->

Equality Impact Assessment (EIA) is a systematic and evidence-based process which verifies that the University's policies and practices are non-discriminatory, and are fair and inclusive in meeting the legitimate needs of the diverse groups that make up the University community.  The key purpose of the Pilot Form and Toolkit is to help identify any Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) impact (positive or negative) associated with new or updated policies, along with any potential discrimination or gaps in policy development.

This form should be completed, in conjunction with the EIA Toolkit Guidelines, and submitted for approval to the relevant governance body in advance of any policy development or major review of existing policy. Equality impacts should continue to be considered throughout the policy drafting process (please see EIA Toolkit Guidelines for details) and the final Equality Impact Assessment Form (with revisions, if required under Outcomes 1-4 below) should be submitted again with the final policy for approval by the relevant governing body.

Socio-economic Status

Select one of the four outcomes below to indicate how the development/review of the policy will be progressed and state the rationale for the decision.

- [ ] Outcome 1: No change required - the assessment is that the policy is/will be robust and/or promotes Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in the University.

- [ ] Outcome 2: Adjust the policy - this involves taking steps to address any adverse impacts before the policy has been developed.

Outline these steps:

- [ ] Outcome 3: Continue the policy while mitigating against any potential adverse impacts. Outline how these adverse impacts can be mitigated against:

- [ ] Outcome 4: Stop the policy or practice, as there are adverse effects which cannot be prevented or mitigated against.

In case of option 2 or option 3, if policy adjustment or mitigation is required, please indicate recommended timeframe before policy requires a further EIA review to ensure it is non-discriminatory and upholds UCD's public sector equality duty.

The form should be signed by the Chair of the Policy Development/Review Group:
