## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the Leave of Absence Academic Policy is to facilitate Governing Boards to support students who may require a leave of absence from their programme in order that they may return to complete their programme. It is one of a range of programme supports available where a student requires a specified period of time off for a variety  of  personal,  medical,  academic  or  pregnancy-related  reasons. The responsibility for deciding the most appropriate course of action for a student in such cases lies with the Governing  Board.

## 2. Definitions

## 2.1 Leave of absence

A leave of absence is defined as an extended period of time away from the programme of study. This is requested by the student and approved by the relevant Governing Board.

The purpose of a leave of absence is to enable and facilitate a student to take an approved and specified period of time off before returning and completing the programme.

## 2.2 Retrospective leave of absence

Retrospective leave of absence is defined as an extended period of time away from the programme of study, where that period of time has passed.

Retrospective leave of absence is not normally permitted. However, it may be granted by a Governing Board where it is satisfied that:

- a. the student has extenuating circumstances,
- b. there is no other available solution for the student given their circumstances, and
- c. the student has not normally been engaged in any programmeactivity. 1

1 A retrospective leave of absence application is not a replacement for an extenuating circumstances application: where there has been student programme activity an extenuating circumstances application would seem most appropriate. Retrospective leave of absence is an additional option that may be considered by the Programme Board where circumstances warrant it. In making an extenuating circumstances application, students should refer to the Policy on Extenuating Circumstances .

## Approved:

21 May 2019 by the Academic Council Executive Committee

## 3. Scope

The Leave  of  Absence  Academic  Policy relates  to  all  undergraduate  and  graduate students  who  may  require  a  leave  of  absence  from  their  programme.  The  policy  and procedures  are  effective  across  the  University.  Governing  Boards  are  responsible  for deciding on all applications. Retrospective applications will be approved by the relevant Governing Board only in the circumstances outlined in item 2.2 above. All applications from students on undergraduate programmes are submitted to their College/School Office and all applications from students on graduate programmes are submitted to their School Office. 2 Students  registered  to  programmes  that  are  run  collaboratively  with  other institutions will normally apply to their home institution.

## 4. Principles

## 4.1 Principles: General

- 4.1.1 The University is committed to fairness in its dealings with all students. In this, it recognises that it may not always be possible for a programme to offer a leave of  absence.  Where a programme cannot offer a leave of absence it should publicise this and communicate it clearly to students.
- 4.1.2 The purpose of a leave of absence is to provide students with time off in order that  they  can  return  to  and  successfully  complete  their  programme.  The University commits to providing information to students during their leave of absence on procedures for returning to the  programme.
- 4.1.3 Students  are  responsible  for  making  it  known  to  their  College/School Office that they might need a leave of absence as soon as is possible and normally in advance of any period of time off.
- 4.1.4 A leave of absence is one of a range of options available to Governing Boards in supporting the academic welfare of their students. It is normally applied for in advance of time.
- 4.1.5 During  a  leave  of  absence,  the  student's  participation  in  the  programme  is suspended. Students may not take a leave of absence in order to remediate failed modules.
- 4.1.6 In the case of UCD staff members who are also students of the University, a leave of absence from their studies should not be assumed to imply that any absence from work has been sanctioned.
- 4.1.7 A retrospective leave of absence will only be granted by the Governing Board in cases where there are extenuating circumstances. Each Governing Board will  submit  an  annual report  documenting all retrospective leave of absence applications it approved during the previous academic session. This report will be submitted to Academic Council or its relevant committee. 3
- 4.1.8 There are a number of possible implications of taking a leave of absence. The University is responsible for providing information regarding possible implications and students are advised to access the variety of support systems within UCD for advice before making a leave of absence application. Students on graduate research programmes are also advised to talk to their Principal Supervisor  in  the  first  instance  should  they  identify  a  need  for  a  leave  of absence from their programme.
- An up-to-date list of support systems within UCD is available at www.ucd.ie/students/services/
- Possible implications of a leave of absence are outlined in the guide to this policy. 4

2 Contact details for all College/ School Offices can be accessed via www.ucd.ie/collegesandschools/

3 The relevant committee of Academic Council to receive these reports is the University Programmes Board (UPB), and reports are normally submitted for the second UPB meeting in an academic session.

4 See www.ucd.ie/students/registration/takingaleaveofabsence/

## 4.2 Principles: Refusing a leave of absence

- 4.2.1 A  student  in  the  first  trimester  of  the  first  stage  of  their  programme  is  not normally eligible for a leave of  absence.
- 4.2.2 A student is not normally eligible for a leave of absence for the trimester following acceptance of a transfer offer.
- 4.2.3 In certain circumstances, e.g. based on programme requirements and structure or research supervisory arrangements, it may not be possible to authorise the requested leave of absence period. In this instance, the Governing Board will recommend  either  an  alternative  leave  of  absence  period  or  an  alternative arrangement for the student.
- 4.2.4 A student is not eligible for a leave of absence where there is a pending disciplinary action.
- 4.2.5 Where a Governing Board refuses a leave of absence application, they have a responsibility to suggest an alternative solution for the student.

## 4.3 Principles: Returning from a leave of absence

- 4.3.1 A  student  is  governed  by  the  University's  Rules,  Regulations,  codes  and policies,  and  the  Programme  regulations  and  structure  in  place  when  they return from a leave of absence.
- 4.3.2 A student will be automatically registered to their programme at the start of the trimester they are due to return from their leave of absence.
- 4.3.3 Where  a  student  requires additional time off, they must  contact their College/School Office, and students on graduate research programmes should contact their Principal Supervisor, before the end of their approved period of leave of absence, in order to make a formal application for a further leave of absence.

Where a student fails to return from a leave of absence and has not applied for a further leave of absence period their registration will be cancelled.

- 4.3.4 A student cannot return from a leave of absence where they are in bad financial standing with the University i.e. where they owe monies to UCD.

## 4.4 Principles: Duration

- 4.4.1 The academic coherence of a student's study is a key consideration in all leave of  absence  applications.  This  policy  is  not  prescriptive  regarding  the  total amount of leave of absence time that a student may be permitted to take over the lifetime of their programme. However, a period 1/3 of the total length of the programme is recommended as the maximum amount of leave of absence time. 5
- 4.4.2 Individual programmes are responsible for publicising the feasibility of a leave of absence period(s) for their programme and should communicate this clearly to students where it is not possible to offer a leave of absence.
- 4.4.3 All Students may apply for a leave of absence for a period of one, two, or three trimesters within an academic year.
- 4.4.4 In extenuating circumstances, students may apply for a leave of absence period equivalent to one trimester if the period of time requested spans two  trimesters.

5 The possibility of withdrawing (and subsequently applying for re-admission) should be discussed where a student requires a longer period of time off.

NOTE: the difference between a leave of absence and a withdrawal is as follows. A student who has taken a leave of absence has the right to resume their studies at the end of the approved leave of absence period. Where a student who has withdrawn wishes, at a later date, to return to that programme, they must apply to be re-admitted.
