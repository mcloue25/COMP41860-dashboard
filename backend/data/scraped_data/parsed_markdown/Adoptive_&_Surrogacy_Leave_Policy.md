## Adoptive Leave and Surrogacy Leave Policy

## Policy owner: UCD HR Approval date and body: 21 September 2021

## 1. Purpose

University College Dublin is committed to providing an inclusive and diverse environment in which all members of our community are valued and supported, both in the workplace and in their family life. As part  of  our  University's  commitment  to  equality,  diversity  and  inclusion,  the  University  has  a comprehensive  suite  of  family-friendly  initiatives  and  policies  available  to  its  employees.  The  UCD Adoptive Leave and Surrogacy Leave policy is one such policy that reflects the high value the University places on our employees. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that UCD employees are supported before, during and after their adoptive/surrogacy leave.

The area of surrogacy is currently unregulated in Ireland. Therefore, in cases of surrogacy there is no statutory  entitlement  to  leave  and  there  is  no  social  welfare  entitlement.  In  line  with  UCD's  equal opportunities approach, a nominated parent who is availing of a surrogate to have children, may avail of leave similar to adoptive leave i.e. Surrogacy Leave. The intending parents can choose who should take the surrogacy leave (i.e. who will be the nominated parent for the purpose of the leave). For the avoidance of doubt, where both commissioning parents are employed by UCD, only one parent will be eligible to avail of surrogacy leave.

This policy does not cover employees who are surrogate mothers, bearing a child on behalf of another person.

## Definitions

Some of the following definitions are based on legislation whilst others are based on good practice in the area.

## Adoptive Parent

An adoptive parent, as per the Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 - 2005, shall be understood to include:

- a. a person in whose care a child (of whom they are not the natural mother) has been placed or is to be placed with a view to the making of an adoption order, or to the effecting of a foreign adoption or following any such adoption;
- b. a man in whose sole care a child has been placed or is to be placed with a view to making an adoption order, or to the effecting of a foreign adoption or following any such adoption; or
- c. the nominated parent of a qualifying couple as set out in the Adoption (Amendment) Act, 2017

## Nominated Parent

The intending parents can choose who should take the adoptive leave or surrogacy leave (i.e. who will be the nominated parent for the purpose of the leave)

## Surrogacy - Relevant Definitions 1

- o Surrogacy Arrangement

A surrogacy arrangement is where a woman agrees to carry and gives birth to a child on behalf of other intending  parents,  and  to  relinquish  care  of  the  child  and  all  rights  of  parentage  and  parental responsibility, to the intending parents.

- o Intending/Commissioning Parents

Intending parent(s) are parties who commission the use of donor gametes/embryo(s) and/or surrogates with the intention of conceiving a child that they will care for from birth. One or both intending parents will be named on the birth cert and one will apply for guardianship on the birth of the child.

- o Guardianship

Guardianship is a bundle of legal rights and responsibilities in respect of a child, including the prima facie right to custody of the child as against anyone who is not a guardian; the right to determine where the child will reside; the right to decide on the child's religious upbringing; and the right to consent to medical treatment. The rules governing guardianship in Irish law are set out in the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 (as amended).

## Adoptive Leave/Surrogacy Leave

## Adoptive Leave:

Under the consolidated Adoptive Leave Acts 1995 - 2005, an adoptive parent is entitled to twenty-four weeks leave from the date of the placement of the child regardless of the length of service. This leave period is known as adoptive leave. The adopting couple can choose who should take the adoptive leave - that is who will be the nominated parent. An adopting couple means a married couple, a couple who are civil partners or a cohabiting couple adopting a child.

Adoptive  Leave  will  commence  as  soon  as  the  child  is  placed  with  the  Adopter  for  adoption.  An employee who intends to take adoptive leave must give adequate notice in writing to their Head of School/Unit.  The  minimum  advance  notice  of  such  intention  is  four  weeks  before  the  expected placement of the child. The expected day of placement may be provided later where this is not possible. However, written notification must be provided no later than the proposed date of commencement of the leave.

## Surrogacy Leave:

In a surrogacy arrangement, a period of surrogacy leave of 24 weeks will be applicable to the nominated parent of intending/commissioning parents upon the birth of the child. Surrogacy leave will commence from the date of birth of the child. An employee who intends to take surrogacy leave must give adequate notice in writing to their Head of School/Unit. The minimum advance notice of such intention is four weeks before the due date of birth of the child.

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

## Additional Unpaid Adoptive Leave/Surrogacy Leave

Adoptive  parents  or  nominated  parents  in  a  surrogacy  arrangement  are  entitled  to  sixteen  weeks additional unpaid leave immediately after their adoptive/surrogacy leave ends. This period is known as additional unpaid adoptive leave/surrogacy leave.

## Adoptive Benefit

Adoptive Benefit is a payment made to parents by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, who are on adoptive leave from work and meet the contribution requirements of social insurance (PRSI) records. Eligible employees are obliged to claim this benefit for the duration of their adoptive leave. This benefit does not apply to surrogacy.

## Normal Salary

Normal  salary  shall  be  understood  to  mean  the  amount  an  employee  receives  each  month/week, excluding  any  overtime,  allowances  or  premiums,  immediately  before  they  begin  their  adoptive leave/surrogacy leave. Allowances, premiums or any other payment that is in excess of the employee's normal  salary,  as  per  their  contract  of  employment,  shall  not  be  paid  during  a  period  of  adoptive leave/surrogacy leave or taken into account when assessing the employee's salary. It is the policy of the University to maintain an eligible employee's salary subject to certain deductions 2 , for the duration of adoptive leave/surrogacy leave.

## 2. Scope

This Adoptive Leave and Surrogacy Leave policy applies to all UCD employees who are in receipt of a salary under a permanent contract, a contract of indefinite duration (CID), or a fixed-term contract as defined in the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act 2003 and who are entitled to benefit under the consolidated Adoption Acts (in the case of adoptive leave). Employees employed under a fixed-term or a specified purpose contract of employment, are entitled to adoptive leave/surrogacy leave for the period of the fixed term or specific purpose only, as set out in their contract of employment. Any entitlement to leave and payment for same shall last only as long as the term of their contract of employment.

## 3. Principles

UCD fosters a culture that embraces equality, diversity and inclusion for all individuals in our community as demonstrated in the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Policy. As such, the principle of equality shall be applied in the interpretation of this policy.

An  employee's  absence  from  work  while  on  adoptive  leave  will  count  for  all  employment  rights associated with their employment such as annual leave, pension and seniority. As Surrogacy Leave is not a statutory entitlement, some statutory entitlements will not be applicable during this leave such as the accruing of annual leave and public holidays. A period of surrogacy leave is non-pensionable.

2 Adoptive Benefit shall be deducted from the employee's salary at source

It is the policy of the University to maintain eligible employee's salaries, subject to certain deductions 3 , for the duration of the adoptive leave/surrogacy leave. Any entitlement to leave and payment for same shall last only as long as the term of the employee's contract of employment.

In  the  event  that  an  intending/commissioning  parent  avails  of  surrogacy  leave  and  subsequently undertakes an adoption process in respect of the child for whom surrogacy leave was already taken, while they may be entitled to avail of statutory adoptive leave, they will not be eligible to receive any voluntary benefits already received under surrogacy leave from UCD (including payments) in respect of any period of adoptive leave.

## Breach of this Adoptive Leave and Surrogacy Policy

Adoptive Leave/Surrogacy leave shall only be used for its intended purpose as per this policy. Where the University has reasonable grounds for believing that an employee, who is on any period of adoptive leave/surrogacy  leave,  is  not  using  the  leave(s)  for  its  intended  purpose,  the  leave(s)  may  be terminated,  and  an  investigation  may  be  carried  out.  Disciplinary  action  may  be  taken  against employees found to be contravening this policy and/or other related policies and procedures.
