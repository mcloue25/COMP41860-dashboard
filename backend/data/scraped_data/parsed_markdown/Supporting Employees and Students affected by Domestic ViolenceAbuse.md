<!-- image -->

## Policy owner EDI Approval date and body

## Purpose

The University recognises that members of its employee and student community can be affected by domestic violence/abuse, and this will have an impact on their safety, wellbeing, and ability to work or study. This may be someone who has experienced domestic violence/abuse in the past, is currently living  with  domestic violence/abuse or as someone who has been impacted upon in another way. Many of those impacted  are prevented from working, forced to work part-time or take sick leave, or become ill, stressed, or lose confidence  as  a  result  of  the  abuse  they  are  subjected  to.  Some  will ultimately cease working. The  aim  of  this  policy  is  to  raise  awareness  regarding  domestic  violence/abuse  and  healthy relationships  and  ensure  that  any  employee  or  student  who  may  be  impacted  by  domestic violence/abuse knows that it is a safe place in which they can disclose so that they can be supported in  their  work or studies. Additionally, this policy is intended to provide line managers and student support roles with a greater understanding of the impact of domestic abuse/or violence and practical supports they can offer. The  policy  has  been  drafted  in  line  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Work  Life  Balance  and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023 and guidance developed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Women's Aid.

This policy will also adhere to the requirements of the  UCD Child Safeguarding Statement.

## Scope

This policy applies to all permanent and temporary employees and all students of UCD. The policy is applicable in all cases regardless of gender although statistics would indicate that women are affected disproportionately. Domestic violence/abuse may occur between individuals who are or have been intimate partners (whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the victim),  or  between  people  who  are  family  members  or  household  members.  It  includes  those employees/students directly impacted by domestic violence/abuse or where they are supporting a relevant person (see definitions section). Domestic violence/abuse can affect anyone irrespective of gender, ethnicity, class, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, family or civil status or any other background. It includes experiences that are ongoing, as well as past experiences.

## Definitions

Domestic Violence/Abuse: For this policy and in line with the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, domestic violence and abuse is defined as: violence, or threat of violence, including sexual violence and acts of coercive control committed against an employee, student or a relevant person (defined below) by another person. The domestic violence may have been committed by:

- a spouse or civil partner of the employee, student or relevant person;
- a cohabitant of the employee, student or relevant person;
- a person who is or was in an intimate relationship with the employee, student or relevant person;
- an adult child of the employee, student or relevant person.

The most common types of domestic abuse are physical, sexual, financial, emotional or psychological abuse (see guidance materials for further information). Abuse is seldom overt, and violence and abuse often increases in frequency and severity over time.

Relevant Person: Under the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, the relevant person is defined as:

- An employee's child (including an adopted child) or dependent;
- An employee's spouse or civil partner;
- A cohabitant of the employee; or
- A person with whom the employee is in an intimate relationship.

All policies and policy related documents and forms are subject to amendment. Please refer to the UCD Governance Document Library website for the official, most recent version.

Victim-Survivor: The term 'victim-survivor' is commonly used language that refers to anyone who has been subjected to domestic abuse. This term is sometimes used to reflect that some people prefer the term 'victim', while others prefer 'survivor'. Some prefer neither term and individuals' preferences should always be respected in direct conversation.

## Domestic Violence Leave (for employees only):

Under the Worklife Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023, employees who have experienced domestic violence/abuse are entitled to up to five days paid leave in any 12 consecutive months. The leave may also be availed of by an employee that is supporting a 'relevant person' (defined above). The domestic violence to which the supports relate includes experiences that are ongoing, as well as past experiences.

There is no minimum service requirement, and no notice period is required as the need may not be foreseeable.  Whilst  there  should  be  confirmation  of  the  leave  being  taken,  further  information regarding the facts surrounding the taking of the leave or documentary evidence/proof should not be requested. The leave can be used to support the employee in a variety of ways see UCD Domestic Violence Leave Guidance Documen t for more information on taking domestic violence leave.

Support  for  Employees  and  Students  impacted  by  domestic  violence/abuse: There  is  no  single approach to supporting individuals as experiences and needs will differ.

Examples of supports/options that employees may find useful are listed below. Employees seeking supports should discuss these options with their line manager in the first instance and support will be provided by the relevant areas to put these in place (confidentially and with consent from the employee).

- Offering temporary/permanent changes in the workplace, work times or patterns
