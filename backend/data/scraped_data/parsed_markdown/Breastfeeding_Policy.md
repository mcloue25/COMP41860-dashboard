## UCD Breastfeeding Policy

Policy owner

Equality, Diversity &amp; Inclusion, UCD HR

## 1. Purpose

Breastfeeding is known to provide considerable health benefits for both parent and baby. The Department of Health and World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding of infants for the first 6 months, after which mothers are recommended to continue breastfeeding in combination with suitably nutritious and safe complementary foods, until their children are two years of age or older. Recognising the importance of breastfeeding for both mothers and their infants, UCD is committed to providing a supportive, family friendly environment and that includes a culture that supports and raises awareness of breastfeeding and the provision of breastfeeding/lactation facilities aligned to good practice for those who wish to use these facilities when breastfeeding.

UCD is entirely breastfeeding friendly and there are no restrictions on bottle or breastfeeding at the University. Any individual is entitled to breastfeed in public places and they do not need to seek permission. (A statement on UCD's support for breastfeeding is available on the UCD EDI website https://www.ucd.ie/equality/support/breastfeeding/.

It is important to UCD that employees who are breastfeeding can return to work and are supported during this period. Enabling employees to balance their work and family commitments supports the University Rising to the Future Strategy, specifically to attract, retain and develop an excellent and diverse cohort of students, faculty and staff.

## 2. Definitions

## Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding means breastfeeding a child or expressing milk and storing it for the purpose of feeding it to the child at a later time. Expressing milk enables a mother to continue to breastfeed upon their return to work. The HSE website (listed on the EDI website) provides useful guidance around the preparation for returning to work and continuing to breastfeed.

## Breastfeeding Breaks

The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 provides an entitlement to paid breastfeeding/lactation breaks - one hour each day away from their work (with pay) or a reduction in work hours in order to breastfeed/lactate. Under the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023 , employees will be entitled to take paid breastfeeding/lactating breaks for two

years (104 weeks) after the period of confinement, which is an increase from the current 6-month entitlement. This supports employees who are breastfeeding while returning to the workplace.

The normal practice for breastfeeding on the return to work is to use the break to express milk and there are many breastfeeding facilities across the campus to support this in UCD but an employee may also choose to breastfeed their child directly during these breaks. If an employee chooses to breastfeed their child directly during these breaks, it is expected that the child would normally be in the care of someone else before and after the breastfeeding break. This may comprise of

- 1x 60 minute period
- 2 x 30 minute periods
- 3x20 minute periods

It should be noted that breastfeeding breaks are to be taken in addition to meal breaks and breaks cannot be accumulated. The breaks may be taken at the start, end or during the day . Part-time staff are entitled to breastfeeding breaks, to be calculated on a pro rata basis.

This break should be constructed in a manner that is agreed between the employee and manager.

Employees should Inform their manager in writing of their request for reduced hours for breastfeeding four weeks before their return from maternity leave

## Breastfeeding Facilities

Facilities are provided by UCD for use by employees for the purposes of breastfeeding/lactation. Facilities provided should be aligned to good practice to ensure the comfort of the employee. Breast milk can be stored within a cooler bag with ice packs or in a shared staff refrigerator within the employee's work area if that is more convenient. It is the responsibility of the employee to ensure that their name and details are clearly marked on all items.

These facilities are also available to students.

These facilities are in place should someone wish to avail of them but there is no requirement by those breastfeeding to use these facilities. Individuals are entitled to breastfeed in public places and do not have to ask anyone for permission. Protection for breastfeeding in public is covered by the Equal Status Act (2000) on gender grounds.
